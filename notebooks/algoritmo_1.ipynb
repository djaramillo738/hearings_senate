Richard Burr \\n(Chairman of the Committee) presiding.\\n    Committee Members Present: Senators Burr, Warner, Risch, \\nRubio, Collins, Blunt, Lankford, Cotton, Cornyn, McCain, Wyden, \\nHeinrich, King, Manchin, and Harris.\\n\\n   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BURR, CHAIRMAN, A U.S. \\n                  SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA\\n\\n    Chairman Burr. I call this hearing to order. I'd like to \\nwelcome our witness today, Senator Dan Coats, President Trump's \\nnominee to be the next Director of National Intelligence. Dan, \\ncongratulations on your nomination and welcome back. I'm sure \\nyou didn't expect to be walking in these halls so soon after \\nyour retirement.\\n    I'd also like to welcome back your wife and my good friend \\nMarsha, and I want to thank her for her support for you and her \\nwillingness to share you with the rest of the country. I've \\nknown both of you for many years and I've seen firsthand the \\nstrength of the relationship that you so thoughtfully describe \\nin your statement for the record.\\n    Our goal in conducting this hearing is to enable the \\ncommittee to consider Senator Coats' qualifications and to \\nallow for thoughtful deliberation by our members. He's already \\nprovided substantive written responses to more than 148 \\nquestions presented by the committee and its members. Today, of \\ncourse, members will be able to ask additional questions and \\nhear from Senator Coats in both open and closed session.\\n    Dan Coats comes to us with more than 34 years of honorable \\nservice in the House, the Senate, and as the U.S. Ambassador to \\nGermany. Those of us who have had the good fortune to work with \\nDan know the depth of his commitment to the intelligence \\ncommunity and, more importantly, to its workforce.\\n    Senator Coats, you've been asked to lead the intelligence \\ncommunity in a time of profound threat and challenge. We're \\nfacing threats from State and non-State actors alike and are \\nengaged in a robust debate at home on the scope and the scale \\nof intelligence collection and what authorities are right, \\nappropriate, and lawful.\\n    I expect you will be a forceful advocate for the \\nintelligence community in those discussions, while maintaining \\nan unwavering respect for the rule of law. I have complete \\ntrust that you will lead the community with integrity and will \\nensure that the intelligence enterprise operates lawfully, \\nethically, and morally.\\n    As the DNI, one of your most important tools will be the \\nlegal authorities provided under the Foreign Intelligence \\nSurveillance Act, scheduled to sunset later this year. They \\nenable the intelligence community to protect our troops, \\nanticipate terrorist threats, and to mitigate cyber attacks, \\nall while safeguarding the privacy and the civil liberties of \\nthe American people.\\n    Simply put, it's essential that Congress authorize these \\nauthorities to help keep the country safe while protecting our \\nconstitutional rights. I look forward to working with you and \\nall of my colleagues to reauthorize FISA as soon as possible.\\n    Dan, I've known you for many years and believe your years \\nof service to our Nation and unique experience make you a \\nnatural fit to lead our intelligence community. As mentioned to \\nDirector Pompeo during his nomination, I can assure you that \\nthis committee will continue to faithfully follow its charter, \\nconduct vigorous and real-time oversight over the intelligence \\ncommunity, its operations, and its activities. We'll ask \\ndifficult and probing questions of you and your staff and we \\nwill expect honest, complete, and timely responses.\\n    I look forward to supporting your nomination and ensuring \\nits consideration without delay. I want to thank you again for \\nbeing here and for your years of service to the country. I look \\nforward to your testimony, and I will now recognize the Vice \\nChairman for any comments he might make.\\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARK R. WARNER, VICE CHAIRMAN, A U.S. \\n                     SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA\\n\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I also \\nwant to welcome you, Dan, and congratulations on your \\nnomination to serve as the fifth Director of the National \\nIntelligence. We have known each other for many years and I \\nbelieve the President has made an excellent choice in asking \\nyou to serve as DNI.\\n    Let me also echo the Chairman's comments in acknowledging \\nyour wife Marsha. I remember our wonderful trips we've had \\ntogether. I would point out that the only thing that I might \\npotentially hold against you is that your so-called sherpa that \\nyou brought along, Senator Chambliss, raises some questions of \\njudgment in my mind, but I won't hold them against you \\nthroughout the whole hearing today.\\n    Senator Coats is well-known to the Senate Intelligence \\nCommittee. He served as a senior member of this committee for \\nmany years and has been an advocate for assertive oversight of \\nthe intelligence community throughout his tenure. Dan firmly \\nbelieves in the value of intelligence and the importance of its \\ntimely, relevant, and absolutely free of political influence.\\n    As the Nation's chief intelligence officer, your job will \\nbe to find and follow the truth regardless of where it leads. \\nIt all comes down to the obligation that we've all talked about \\non this committee when we served together: tell truth to power, \\nto the President, to the policy and military leaders, to the \\nExecutive Branch, to members of Congress. Maintaining your \\nintegrity and independence even in the face of political \\npressure is an absolute requirement of this position.\\n    Dan, the job for which you've been nominated has many \\nrewards and possibly even more challenges. You will be expected \\nto lead an enterprise, as we've talked about privately, of 17 \\ndiverse intelligence agencies. In some areas you will have \\nclear authority to direct actions. But, as we know, in most \\nareas the ODNI has to also convince rather than simply having \\ndirect authority.\\n    You'll be expected to serve as the President's top \\nintelligence officer, to coordinate and integrate intelligence \\ncommunity activities, to lead the work to enhance the \\neffectiveness and efficiency of the intelligence enterprise and \\nensure the integrity of that analytic product.\\n    While these are just a few of the many issues you will \\nface, I know you're up to the challenge. But I need to make \\nclear, even in my opening statement, that one of the first \\nchallenges I will ask you to take on, head on, is to support \\nour efforts to understand Russia's interference in the 2016 \\nPresidential election. As you know, this committee is \\nconducting an investigation into that interference. We're also \\nlooking into whether any individuals associated with U.S. \\npolitical campaigns inappropriately engaged with officials of \\nthe Russian government. And we will seek to determine what the \\nintentions of those interactions were.\\n    We take this matter very, very seriously. The Chairman and \\nI, as well as members of the committee on both sides of the \\naisle, have made commitments that the outcome of this \\ninvestigation will not be prejudged and that the committee will \\nfollow wherever the information leads. We need to get it right. \\nIt's my intention that this investigation will remain \\nbipartisan and seek to be as transparent as possible and remain \\nfree of any political consideration or interference, including, \\nincluding interference from the White House. I will not accept \\nany process that is undermined by such political interference.\\n    This inquiry will be thorough and it will be exhaustive, \\nbecause at end of the day what we owe most is answers to the \\nAmerican public. You know how important this type of inquiry \\nis. It's not about being a Democrat or Republican. Nor is it \\nabout relitigating the 2016 election. This is truly about \\nupholding the core values and sanctity of the democracy that \\nall Americans hold dear. Our plan is to review both the raw and \\nfinished intelligence and understand how the intelligence \\ncommunity made its conclusions on Russian interference.\\n    And I will ask you today again to commit to all members of \\nthis committee that you will fully cooperate with this review \\nand that you will direct all the intelligence community \\nagencies to provide all the information that we require, \\nincluding the raw information, to make sure we get it right.\\n    On other topics, you and I had a very good conversation in \\nmy office a few weeks ago, where again we talked about the fact \\nthat we didn't think you'd be back in so quickly. I very much \\nappreciated that conversation. And you assured me there that \\nyou will not support the return of waterboarding or other so-\\ncalled ``enhanced interrogation practices,'' nor will you \\nsupport reestablishing secret detention sites operated by the \\nIC.\\n    You also assured me that you will always present to the \\nPresident, his Cabinet and advisers and Congress the \\nunvarnished facts as represented by the best judgment of the \\nintelligence community, whether that analysis is in agreement \\nor disagreement with the views of the President or, for that \\nmatter, anyone else. Again, I will ask you today to reaffirm \\nthose commitments that you made to me and make them publicly to \\nthe American public.\\n    Finally, if confirmed--and I look forward to supporting \\nyou--you will have the unique challenge of working for a \\nPresident who has said comments that I believe at times have \\ndenigrated some of the work of the intelligence community. So \\nyou will have a very incredibly important role to make sure \\nthat the brave men and women who serve us, often in anonymity, \\nthat you will have their back, and that you will make sure that \\nthe morale of these brave men and women is increased and is \\nrespected.\\n    Senator Coats, again I want to thank you for being with us \\ntoday. I want to thank you for your willingness to serve. And I \\nlook forward to working with the Chairman as we go through this \\nhearing. Thank you, very much.\\n    Chairman Burr. Thank you, Vice Chairman.\\n    I'd like to now recognize our former colleague, former Vice \\nChairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, and my good \\nfriend, Saxby Chambliss, who will be introducing Senator Coats.\\n    Saxby.\\n\\n  STATEMENT OF HON. SAXBY CHAMBLISS, FORMER U.S. SENATOR FROM \\n                            GEORGIA\\n\\n    Senator Chambliss. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Mr. \\nVice Chairman, members of the Committee.\\n    Chairman Burr. Cut on that microphone, would you? I know \\nit's been a long time since you've been here.\\n    Senator Chambliss. You know, when I was in the Senate \\nsomebody did all this for me. I've had to adjust to a lot of \\nthings like that.\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    It's really good to be back in front of so many friends on \\nthis committee and, as much as I miss each of you individually, \\nI have to tell you I am frankly happy to be on this side of the \\ndais today.\\n    I'm here today to introduce to you a friend of all of us, \\nSenator Dan Coats, who has been nominated by President Trump to \\nbe the fifth Director of National Intelligence.\\n    S. 2645 was introduced by Senators Feinstein, Rockefeller, \\nand Bob Graham on the 19th of June, 2002. Then, after two and a \\nhalf years of discussion and debate, the Intel Reform and \\nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004 was passed overwhelmingly by \\nboth the House and the Senate and signed into law by President \\nBush. That Act created the Office of the Director of National \\nIntelligence and placed all of the--it placed the DNI at the \\nhead of the 16 member intelligence agencies.\\n    The DNI was charged with directing and overseeing the \\nnational intelligence program and to serve as an adviser to the \\nPresident and the executive offices of the National Security \\nCouncil and the Homeland Security Council about intelligence \\nmatters related to the national security of the United States.\\n    Today I understand that ODNI has somewhere around 2,000 \\nemployees who support the DNI's oversight responsibility for \\nthe entire National Intelligence Program of some $53 billion. \\nSome have recently questioned the structure and effectiveness \\nof ODNI, and perhaps after 12 years of the creation of a new \\nagency, particularly one as sensitive as this, perhaps a review \\nis in order.\\n    But there is one thing that cannot be overlooked, and that \\nis that during these 12 years, with strong leadership from the \\nDNI, from a commitment to security by dedicated employees at \\nODNI, and by very good oversight of this committee and the \\nHPSCI, ODNI has led an IC that has produced intelligence to its \\ncustomers that has prevented another large-scale attack against \\nAmerica on U.S. soil.\\n    We all know that the world is a more dangerous place than \\never today. Bad guys are greater in number and more \\nsophisticated in their operations than ever before. Thus, the \\nstrong leadership from the DNI is more important today than \\never. No one is better suited to give that leadership than is \\nour friend and former colleague, Dan Coats.\\n    As Ambassador to Germany, he was a customer of the IC. As a \\nlong-time member of this committee, Dan participated in \\nconducting extensive oversight of the IC. Now he will be \\nproviding the intelligence that is to be subjected to that \\noversight. His experience prepares him well for both these new \\nroles.\\n    I have traveled the world with Dan Coats many times, \\nvisiting our counterparts, our allies, as well as world \\nleaders, and, while Dan is for the most part, as we all know, \\nvery friendly and easy-going, I have had the opportunity to \\nobserve Dan being very firm and direct in addressing sensitive \\nand difficult issues with all of those individuals that we have \\nvisited and doing so in a very professional manner.\\n    Dan has been in public service since 1976 when he was \\ndistrict director for then-Congressman Dan Quayle. He then \\nserved in the House of Representatives, the United States \\nSenate, Ambassador to Germany, and then again in the U.S. \\nSenate. Now, after that remarkable 40-year career, Dan is \\nwilling to continue to serve his country as the DNI.\\n    Lastly, let me say that a lot of Dan's strength comes from \\nthe constant support he has received from his lovely wife, \\nMarsha, to whom he's been married for now over 50 years. I will \\nleave it to Dan to introduce her, but suffice it to say she's \\nbeen a great teammate. Using a little sports nomenclature \\nthere, since I still have my Top Secret clearance I get some \\npretty good intelligence from time to time, and one piece of \\nintelligence I picked up on about Dan is that he's a huge \\nChicago Cubs fan. Needless to say, he felt pretty good last \\nfall.\\n    But one other thing I found out about him is that the day \\nafter he and Marsha were married he took her to a Cubs game. \\nAnd his marriage still survived that.\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    It is my pleasure to introduce to you Senator Dan Coats, \\nand I urge all of you to vote to send Dan's nomination to the \\nfloor of the Senate quickly and to very quickly confirm him as \\nthe new Director of National Intelligence.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Burr. Saxby, thank you.\\n    Dan, if you would stand, please. Raise your right hand. Do \\nyou solemnly swear to give the committee the truth, the full \\ntruth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.\\n    Senator Coats. I do, so help me.\\n    Chairman Burr. Please be seated.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF HON. DAN COATS, FORMER U.S. SENATOR FROM INDIANA, \\n       NOMINATED TO BE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE\\n\\n    Chairman Burr. Dan, before we move to your statement, I'd \\nlike to ask you to answer five questions that are standard for \\nthe committee. We pose them to each nominee who appears before \\nus. They just require simple yes or a no answer for the record. \\nDo you agree to appear before the committee here and in other \\nvenues when invited?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes.\\n    Chairman Burr. If confirmed, do you agree to send officials \\nfrom your office to appear before the committee and designated \\nstaff when invited?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes.\\n    Chairman Burr. Do you agree to provide documents or any \\nother materials requested by the committee in order for us to \\ncarry out our oversight and legislative responsibilities?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes.\\n    Chairman Burr. Will you both ensure that your office and \\nyour staff provides such materials to the committee when \\nrequested?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes.\\n    Chairman Burr. Do you agree to inform and fully brief to \\nthe fullest extent possible all members of the committee of \\nintelligence activities and covert action, rather than only the \\nChair and Vice Chairman where appropriate?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes, where appropriate. Yes, where \\nappropriate.\\n    Chairman Burr. I want to thank you very much. We'll now \\nproceed to your opening statement. You're recognized.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    I have remarks thanking Saxby. He needs to leave and I want \\nto jump ahead just a little bit of what I am going to say in my \\nwritten remarks to you, just to thank him, a great friend, \\nsomeone I had the pleasure of serving under on this committee. \\nHe has left his mark in many, many ways, including friendship \\namong his wife and Saxby between Marsha and me. I just want to \\nthank him for being willing to come here today and to make \\nthese remarks on my behalf.\\n    Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Warner, members of the \\ncommittee: I'm honored to appear before you as nominee for the \\nposition of Director of National Intelligence. It was a great \\nprivilege of mine to have served on the Senate Select \\nCommittee, this committee, on Intelligence, and to see up close \\nthe great work done by all the members of the staff and their \\nsupporters.\\n    I'll admit, however, that the view is a little bit \\ndifferent down here from up there. In fact, I recall many days \\nsitting up there, looking to who was ever down here, and \\nsaying, I'm glad that's not me. Well, here I am.\\n    I'd like to begin by thanking President Trump for \\nnominating me for the position of Director of National \\nIntelligence. I'm humbled by his confidence in me and will work \\ntirelessly to lead the world's, what I believe and I think most \\nbelieve, the finest intelligence enterprise in the world.\\n    I would like to also thank Vice President Pence, my Indiana \\ncolleague and someone that I'm honored to call my friend, for \\nhis support. I deeply appreciate his faith in me.\\n    I would also like to acknowledge the work of the previous \\nDNI, Jim Clapper, and his Principal Deputy, Stephanie \\nO'Sullivan. Their oversight of the intelligence community of \\nthe past years has been commendable and their guidance in \\nhelping me prepare for this position has been most helpful. \\nThey left in place an experienced and a great team which have \\nbeen instrumental in providing a smooth transition for the ODNI \\nand for the IC.\\n    Also, I want to recognize my fellow Hoosiers, who elected \\nme several times to the House of Representatives and to the \\nUnited States Senate over the past years. I've always done my \\nbest to represent them and I'm honored by the confidence that \\nthey have put in me time and time again. While I will always be \\na Hoosier at heart, if confirmed as the next Director of \\nNational Intelligence I will represent the dedicated men and \\nwomen of the Office of Director of National Intelligence and \\nthe broader intelligence community to the best of my ability.\\n    Finally, saving the best for last, I would like to thank my \\nwife Marsha, my children Laura, Lisa, and Andrew, who is here \\ntoday. Together my three children have produced, according to \\nMarsha's and my observation, ten almost perfect grandchildren. \\nMy career in public service is a direct reflection of my \\nfamily's enduring support and love and without their \\nencouragement I would not be sitting here today.\\n    It's been a long road of public service that's brought me \\nhere before you. After 34 years of service in the House, the \\nSenate and as U.S. Ambassador to Germany, I was ready to make a \\ntransition and planned to move on to a new chapter of my life-\\nlong journey, back home again to Indiana.\\n    But, as I have learned over those 34 years, life doesn't \\nalways work out the way you think it's going to work out. When \\ncalled upon to consider this position, I first consulted my \\nmost important adviser, my wife Marsha, as I examined the \\nresponsibilities of such a significant office. As a former \\nteacher and family therapist, Marcia understands me probably \\nbetter than anybody and the importance of public service. She \\nis the rock that provides stability and wise counsel, shoulder \\nto shoulder with me in every aspect of my life.\\n    And while I'm no longer retiring from public service, what \\nI am retiring as I sit here today is my policy hat, a hat I \\nwore proudly for years as I represented the views of my \\nconstituents, offered policy proposals, made judgments and cast \\nvotes in the committee and on the floor. That will be replaced. \\nIt's retired.\\n    But if confirmed I put on a new hat, the DNI hat. And just \\nas this government transitions to a new leadership, I too hope \\nto transition to the role of principal intelligence adviser to \\nthe President and all the duties that come with that. In this \\nnew role it will be my responsibility to present the President, \\nsenior policymakers throughout the Administration, and you the \\nCongress with the best and most objective, nonpolitical and \\ntimely intelligence as you consider policies in the future for \\nour great Nation.\\n    The President and I have personally discussed my potential \\nrole as his principal intelligence adviser and we both \\nrecognize that this position is frequently the bearer of \\nunpleasant news. But if confirmed, my responsibility would be \\nto provide him with the most accurate and objective and \\napolitical intelligence possible.\\n    In my various conversations with many of you prior to this \\nhearing I was asked about how I see the larger role of the DNI. \\nThose who know me--and Saxby referenced this, that I'm an avid \\nsports fan and never more avid than this past year as I \\ncelebrated the seemingly impossible accomplishment of the \\nChicago Cubs after 108 years of effort, winning the World \\nSeries.\\n    So allow me to compare how I see my role as DNI using, \\nwell, not a baseball analogy, but a football analogy. On a \\nfootball team the players are guided by a variety of coaches. \\nYou see them standing along the sidelines and wonder how many \\nthere are. At one time I counted and I thought there were 17 \\nand I thought that meant something here relative to the number \\nof agencies we look after.\\n    There's a coach for offense, a coach for defense, special \\nteams, one for the offensive line, one for the defensive line, \\none for the quarterback and on and on it goes. But every team \\nhas a head coach, that leader who walks the sidelines and, \\nwhile not dictating to each coach, assistant coach, how to do \\ntheir specific job, pulls each of these specialists together to \\nform a seamless and focused team.\\n    I see the role of Director of National Intelligence as \\nanalogous to the head coach role for the intelligence \\ncommunity, integrating the IC and leveraging all the expertise \\nin our community. We have immense talent resident in many of \\nthe agencies across the IC. Yet each one contributes unique \\ncapabilities or expertise that is necessary for a team to be as \\na whole successful: the unique access of our human intelligence \\nsources and the detailed analysis from the Central Intelligence \\nAgency; the important input from the Defense Intelligence \\nAgency; the signals intelligence expertise of the National \\nSecurity Agency, which I believe is second to none; the \\ngeospatial mastery demonstrated by the National Geospatial-\\nIntelligence Agency; the acquisition proficiency of our \\nsatellite specialists at the National Reconnaissance Office; \\nthe force multiplier the intelligence elements of the armed \\nservices bring to this team effort; the domestic \\ncounterterrorism and counter-intelligence work done by the \\nFederal Bureau of Investigation; and the specialized skills of \\nthe IC elements resident within the Departments of State, \\nTreasury, Justice, Homeland Security, and Energy.\\n    Like a head coach, I see it as my job to pull all of these \\nteam members together under the same game, to produce the best \\ncoordinated and the best integrated intelligence we can find, \\nto make the whole greater than the sum of the parts. And given \\nthe complicated threat environment that we face today in this \\ncountry and around the world, now more than ever the IC must \\nwork as a team.\\n    The threats that we face today are more challenging, \\ndynamic, and geographically diffuse than ever before. Allow me \\nto address in no particular order what I see as some of the \\nmost challenging issues we currently face. And I could spend a \\nlot of time on this, so I will abbreviate and talk about just a \\nfew.\\n    Clearly the rising cyber threat must be highlighted. \\nCyberspace is both a resource and a liability, an increasingly \\nconnected world that creates opportunities, but also many \\nvulnerabilities.\\n    Not unrelated, I would also highlight the threat of radical \\nIslamic terrorism, which continues to be a significant threat \\nto the United States and its allies abroad. They're spreading \\ntheir message of fear and hate through cyberspace and \\nmobilizing to venues beyond their self-described caliphate.\\n    China's continued regional activism, including its disputed \\nterritorial claims in the East and South China Seas is \\ntroubling and will be a long-term challenge for the United \\nStates.\\n    Russia's assertiveness in global affairs is something I \\nlook upon with grave concern, which we need to address with \\neyes wide open and a healthy degree of skepticism. And North \\nKorea's nuclear ambitions and, quite frankly, provocations are \\nsomething the intelligence community needs to be laser-focused \\non.\\n    The list continues with a diverse set of challenges, \\nincluding those in Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, and other hot \\nspots around the world. In order to address these threats, I \\nwill bring my years of experience on how to execute on a plan \\nand bring together teams of people toward a common goal.\\n    As the Ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005, I oversaw \\nthe activity of more than a dozen Federal agencies at the \\nAmerican Embassy. I trust that my experiences coordinating and \\nintegrating that many different departments and agencies, \\noverseeing their activities, leveraging their strengths and \\nbringing them together under a single strategy will serve me \\nwell as DNI.\\n    As a member of Congress in both the House and Senate, I \\nhave always had a keen interest, as hopefully you know, in \\nensuring that we are responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. \\nIn evaluating Federal programs, I always made it a point to ask \\nquestions about what works, what doesn't and why. I also \\nbelieved it was important to assess how we establish \\npriorities. We must ask ourselves, in a time of tightened \\nbudgets, what programs are truly essential and which may no \\nlonger be necessary or only partly necessary or of lower \\npriority?\\n    How does each program support our overall goal or strategy \\nand is it duplicative of another effort? I will be looking to \\nask the IC these and many more questions if confirmed as DNI.\\n    In the vein of efficiency, there has been much discussion \\nabout the role of the DNI and the Office of the DNI. Let me \\nshare with you what I have learned in preparation for this \\nopportunity. Over the last 12 years since its inception, the \\nODNI has been tasked with a variety of responsibilities, in \\nstatute, many in statute, in Executive Orders, and in \\nPresidential memoranda, along with recommendations coming from \\nthe 9/11 Commission and the Silberman-Robb Commission on WMD.\\n    The people supporting these directives are hard-working \\nfolks from all across the IC. Of note, a significant portion of \\nthe ODNI's workforce is on rotation from other IC agencies. As \\nyou know also, NCTC, an organization of 750 people, created by \\nthe law enacted in 2005, is counted in that number that we \\nhave, which is less than 2,000 and, by the way, less than a \\nthird of the number of band members for the armed services. So \\nthat may put it in some perspective.\\n    ODNI was established to counter the pre-9/11 stove-piping \\nby individual intelligence agencies and ensure collaboration \\nand integration across the intelligence elements. The people \\nwho are supporting these directives are hard-working folks from \\nall across the IC.\\n    ODNI brings together talent from across the community to \\nintegrate intelligence and does its best to connect the dots--\\nnot just specific dots from the specific agencies and \\nspecialties. In keeping with my earlier football analogy, you \\ncan't play a complete game with just a star quarterback and a \\nwide receiver. Maybe if you're the New England Patriots you can \\npull that off once in a while, but I don't think that happens \\nvery often. But even the Pats need a strong offensive line, a \\nstout defense, agile special teams and a talented place kicker, \\nalong with many other players, to be the best in the business.\\n    Not every player in a football team is going to be the MVP, \\nbut they are a team nonetheless and everyone on the field plays \\na critical role. And when we the IC succeed, we succeed as a \\nteam. If we come up short, we fail as a team and we use that \\nexperience to address it so that doesn't happen again.\\n    As I looked at the many requirements of the office \\nreflected in various laws, orders and recommendations, I have \\nbeen impressed by the office's responsiveness to these many \\ntasks within the reasonable resources that they have. Recent \\ncommentary on the size of the ODNI doesn't mesh with what I've \\nseen firsthand and I believe it does a disservice to this \\ncommittee and your efforts to keep the size of ODNI in check, \\nwhich is your obligation and my obligation.\\n    That said, as I discussed earlier, I believe every \\ngovernment agency must constantly review its operations, and \\nI'll be taking a look at not only the ODNI, but the entire IC, \\nand try to learn how we can do things more efficiently and \\neffectively. We don't have a choice.\\n    Much has been made publicly about the role of our \\nintelligence enterprise and how it will fare in the future, and \\nI'm encouraged by what I see. With the leadership team in place \\nat the IC agencies, I know that this community will continue as \\nthe world-class intelligence enterprise it is today.\\n    Before going to questions, let me just share with you the \\nearly goals that, if confirmed, I will share with the IC. I \\nintend to push the IC to be the best it can and not accept the \\nstatus quo when it comes to challenges facing our Nation. I \\nintend to ask the IC to be innovative in its approach to hard \\nproblems and the solutions to solve them.\\n    I intend to be a champion for the hard-working men and \\nwomen of the IC, be there for them the way they are here for \\nall of us. Every day the men and women of the IC are working \\ntirelessly on the front lines, often in the shadows, oftentimes \\nin very dangerous situations, with a common goal of keeping \\nAmerica safe and secure.\\n    I also intend to work with all of you, as a former member \\nof the committee, to assure you that the IC has the support it \\nneeds to tackle whatever the opposing teams bring our way and \\nto ensure that the Congress and this committee have access to \\nthe information you need to conduct your oversight \\nresponsibilities.\\n    I am honored by the opportunity to be here today and I \\nthank you for your consideration of my nomination. And with \\nthat, I look forward to answering your questions.\\n    [The prepared statement of Senator Coats follows:]\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n    \\n    Chairman Burr. Dan, thank you very much.\\n    Let me say for members, I'll recognize members in order of \\nseniority for a five-minute round. For those that need it, we \\nwill have a follow-up round. Just for members' timing, we'll go \\nfrom the open hearing immediately when complete to a closed \\nhearing for whatever period that might take, and that will be \\nin our normal hearing room.\\n    With that, let me recognize myself for five minutes. Dan, \\nyou and Marsha had a good gig, you know, retirement. She was \\nexcited. You were actually really excited--34 years. Now you've \\ngot--now you've agreed to do a job that many have called \\nthankless. Why?\\n    Senator Coats. I've been asked that question many times at \\neach step of the journey, and the response has always come down \\nto a sense of duty. When asked to serve your country, whether \\nit was in uniform, which I did for two years, or whether it was \\nin the Congress or as Ambassador and the run for the Senate \\nagain after quite a hiatus, and then to say yes to this job, I \\nwas reminded of the phrase that runs through my mind: I dreamt, \\nI believed that life was a beauty, and I think that's what I \\nwas looking forward to. I awoke and found that life is a duty.\\n    So I believe, if asked by your leader of your country to \\nserve your country again, the answer needed to be yes.\\n    Chairman Burr. I know you understand well from your \\nexperience on the committee how valuable raw intelligence can \\nbe to the oversight process. If asked by committee, will you \\nprovide the raw intelligence and sourcing behind intelligence \\ncommunity finished product and assessments?\\n    Senator Coats. I absolutely believe that is my \\nresponsibility and the responsibility of the IC, to provide \\nwhat this committee needs to do its oversight properly.\\n    Chairman Burr. I noticed in your statement that you \\nhighlighted, and I quote, ``acquisition proficiency of our \\nsatellite specialists,'' unquote, at the National \\nReconnaissance Office. I'm sure you probably agree, however, \\nthat the requirements development process for our satellites is \\nin need of significant reform. Will you work with the committee \\nto streamline that process to ensure that we can more quickly \\nget to the design, build and launch phase?\\n    Senator Coats. Absolutely. Agility is critical in this time \\nof rapid technological change. We see, I believe now, 11 \\nnations who have the capacity to launch instruments into space. \\nI was shocked the other day to read that the nation of India on \\none rocket launch deposited more than 100 satellites in space. \\nThey may be small in size with different functions and so \\nforth, but one rocket can send up I think it was 111 platforms.\\n    We cannot afford to be behind the curve in terms of \\ndevelopment of both the offensive and defensive capacities that \\nwe put up into space. And so, streamlining that acquisition \\nprocess is not something that, yeah, should be done; it's of \\nutmost urgency that it has to be done.\\n    Chairman Burr. There's been much discussion about the role \\nthat the Central Intelligence Agency played in the detention \\nand interrogation of terrorist suspects as part of the RDI \\nprogram. Those detention facilities operated by the CIA have \\nlong been closed and President Obama officially ended the \\nprogram seven years ago.\\n    I think the debate space on this subject has become \\nconfused and I'm certain that the law is now very clear. Do you \\nagree that it would require a change in law for the CIA or any \\ngovernment agency to lawfully employ any interrogation \\ntechniques beyond those defined in the Army Field Manual?\\n    Senator Coats. I absolutely support that. That is the law. \\nI might note for the committee, you may--I'll bring it up if \\nyou don't. When that vote on the NDAA came up, the McCain \\nAmendment, I was one of a few who did not support that \\namendment. First of all, I absolutely will follow the law in \\nevery aspect regardless of what my personal thoughts might be.\\n    I only had one reservation that I couldn't reconcile in my \\nmind. I didn't think no because I didn't think that's where we \\nneeded to go. I voted no because I thought perhaps we ought to \\nat least have a discussion about what do you do in a situation \\nwhen you have the necessary intelligence to know that something \\nterrible is going to happen to the American people in a very \\nshort amount of time and you have the legitimate individual who \\ncan tell you where that radiological bomb or biological \\nmaterial is and you don't have time to go through the process \\nthat the Army Field Manual requires?\\n    I'm not saying that should--I'm not saying--I'm not \\ntrying--as I said, I took off my policy hat. I'm no longer \\nengaged in that process. I follow the law that's there and I \\nensure that the IC follows the law, and the answer to your \\nquestion is absolutely.\\n    But I do think it's at least worth discussion relative to \\nthe situation that might occur where we might have to, \\nhopefully with some special authority, might have to go outside \\nthat. I don't have the prescription for that. I'm not going to \\nadvocate for that. I'm simply trying to define what was going \\nthrough my mind when that amendment came up. I thought we \\nneeded a little more discussion on that. That was on the policy \\nside. That hat's gone.\\n    Chairman Burr. You mentioned in your opening statement that \\nyou intend to ask the intelligence committee to be innovative \\nin its approach to hard problems. I just want to say this, Dan: \\nAs you know, I've been pushing the community to innovate for \\nmany years, and I look forward to working with you and \\nsupporting this endeavor to change an IC community that looks \\nforward with innovation as an opportunity, as have many on this \\ncommittee.\\n    Turn to the Vice Chairman.\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Let me echo what the Chairman has said about satellites and \\nour whole overhead capacity. I think you were part of many \\nvigorous debates that we had to make changes in that field and \\nmake it much more future-oriented and recognize, as you pointed \\nout, both other nations moving in this area and tremendous \\nopportunities within the commercial space. So I appreciate your \\nanswer on that.\\n    I do want to, as I mentioned in my opening statement, \\nthough, get you back on the record on a couple of items that I \\nthink are terribly important. I want to start again with an \\nissue of great importance to me and I believe this committee, \\nand that is our current investigation into the Russian hacking \\nattempts. Do you promise to fully and completely cooperate with \\nthe committee's investigation of the Russian election hacking, \\nincluding by turning over all requested IC cables, intelligence \\nproducts, and other materials to the committee as promptly as \\npossible?\\n    Senator Coats. I think it's our responsibility to provide \\nyou access to all that you mentioned.\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. And do you plan to continue any \\ninvestigations the IC is carrying out or may carry out \\nregarding Russia's active measures, especially as they refer to \\ninterference in elections in our country and, for that matter, \\ncountries around the world?\\n    Senator Coats. I think this is something that needs to be \\ninvestigated and addressed. I have not seen the classified \\ninformation on that. As my colleagues may or may not know, the \\nday you go sine die here and you're leaving the Senate you lose \\nyour classification. You have to start over at zero. It took \\nmuch longer than we had anticipated. So I just received it last \\nThursday. I was back in Indiana last week helping to try to \\nclose things down there to return here. So I have not had the \\nopportunity to be briefed on what the classified version of \\nthat investigation has come up with.\\n    So in answer to your question, yes, I think this is an \\nissue. Russia has a long history of propaganda and trying to \\ninfluence various nations' cultures and elections and so forth. \\nIt's happening in Europe now as we speak. But they seem to have \\nstepped up their game and they are using cyber and they are \\nusing sophisticated methods now that they didn't have before.\\n    So I think it's a very key issue that we understand fully \\nwhat has happened and how it's happened and have a full report \\non that. I certainly will make sure the IC produces the \\nintelligence access that you need to do your job.\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. I appreciate your answer.\\n    Obviously, one of the core functions of the IC--and as ODNI \\nyou'll have to coordinate this, the analogy back to the coach--\\nof making sure that you speak truth to power. You've got a \\nremarkable background, but you will be the first DNI who was \\nnot either career military, career intelligence, or a career \\nprofessional diplomat, and again similar to Mike Pompeo, being \\nmore a political or a policy advocate. How will you ensure that \\nthe intelligence community will continue to provide unvarnished \\nassessments to the President and his Administration regardless \\nof any politics?\\n    Senator Coats. Well, that's our responsibility and that's \\nmy primary responsibility, to make sure that the intelligence \\ncommunity knows exactly what our standards are, what we can do \\nand what we can't do. I want to make it very, very clear to all \\nelements of the intelligence community that our job is to do \\nour job, and our job is not to formulate policy, our job is not \\nto influence intelligence in any way for political reasons; our \\njob is to present the, as you said, truth to those who make \\npolicy decisions about where we go. And I will not tolerate--I \\nwill not tolerate anything that falls short of that standard.\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. Thank you.\\n    The Chairman raised the issue around the current law in \\nterms of the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation. I would \\nsimply point out that every day in one form or another the \\nmilitary deals with some form or another of the so-called \\nticking time bomb scenario. And I believe General Mattis has \\nappropriately pointed out that he would not stray from the Army \\nField Manual because he feels the so-called ``enhanced \\ninterrogation techniques'' just don't work. I would hope that \\nyou would echo again what you said in the last, that you would \\ncommit to following the law and not lead some effort to try to \\nchange that law.\\n    Senator Coats. I can absolutely say that I have no other \\nobligation except to follow the law on that. I would say, I \\ngreatly respect the views of John McCain, who not only \\nunderstands this but has been subject to it, and General Mattis \\nand his years and years of experience. I respect both of those \\nand I intend to be available to work with them and talk with \\nthem. But the goal is clear, the law is clear, and following \\nwhat that law is is my primary responsibility and I will adhere \\nto that.\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Risch.\\n    Senator Risch. Dan, I don't really have any questions for \\nyou. You sat right here for all the time that you did and I \\nknow what your decision-making is like, and you and I wrestled \\nwith some of these tough decisions we had to make and I know \\nwhat your analysis is like and I have absolutely confidence. I \\nthink it was a great appointment by the President.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Senator Risch. Thank you, and especially thank Marsha for \\nagreeing that you could do this job. We really appreciate it, \\nAmerica appreciates it. Thank you for your willingness to do \\nthat.\\n    Senator Coats. Just a comment. I've been sitting here \\nlooking at that empty chair. Who died?\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    Senator Risch. That's Senator Rubio's chair now and----\\n    Senator Coats. Oh, I'm sorry.\\n    Senator Risch [continuing]. I'm not going to comment.\\n    Senator Coats. I hope he's not watching on C-Span. He'll be \\nshowing up through the door.\\n    Senator Risch. I'm not going to comment on the trade that \\nwas made here. But again, thanks much.\\n    As you know, they are remodeling your office that's next to \\nmine on the fourth floor. Man, it's, it's a mess. I wish you \\nhadn't have left, to be honest with you.\\n    Senator Coats. Were you able to seize a new room on the \\nother end there?\\n    Senator Risch. No, I wasn't. But that doesn't mean I didn't \\ntry.\\n    Senator Coats. Well, I could probably try to help you on \\nthat.\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    Senator Risch. Thank you.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Wyden.\\n    Senator Wyden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    It's good to see my former Finance Committee partner in the \\ncause of bipartisan tax reform. I was a little baffled in all \\nthe references to football since Hoosiers are about my game, \\nbasketball. But we'll talk about that another time.\\n    In January of 2017, the intelligence community issued a \\nwritten assessment that Vladimir Putin and the Russian \\ngovernment developed a clear preference for President-elect \\nTrump. Given President Putin's--excuse me. Given Putin's \\npreferences, how are you going to actually show our allies, \\nwith elections coming up, that the intelligence community will \\nsupport them against Russian efforts to influence their \\nelections?\\n    Senator Coats. Well, as I said earlier, Russia has a long \\nhistory of doing this, although they've stepped up their game \\nand they're using more sophisticated tactics. As I also said, I \\nhaven't seen the classified version of this, but I think it's \\npublicly known and acknowledged and accepted that Russia \\ndefinitely did try to influence the campaign. To what extent \\nthey were successful, I don't think we know.\\n    But following through on that in terms of informing our \\nallies of what we have experienced and what they're probably \\ngoing to experience gives them I think the ability to better \\nunderstand what the Russian efforts are.\\n    I think the transparency of what has happened is necessary \\nfor the American people so that when they make their judgments \\nabout future, whether future elections or whatever, they \\nunderstand that there are outside forces trying to influence \\nthem one way or another.\\n    I do think this is an issue that ought to be looked at \\ncarefully and there needs to be, frankly, a response. Vice \\nPresident Pence at the Munich Security Conference--I was not \\nthere, but I read his remarks--said there needs to be \\nconsequences for what the Russians are trying to do.\\n    Senator Wyden. What I hope we'll see is that, because \\npeople are concerned that what happened to us will happen to \\nthem, that you will make intelligence-sharing with these \\ncountries a priority.\\n    Senator Coats. I think that's already being done, and needs \\nto be done.\\n    Senator Wyden. I wanted to hear it from you. But we'll move \\non.\\n    You said that if you're confirmed, the reauthorization of \\nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act would \\nbe your top legislative priority. For years, I and members of \\nCongress have been asking for an estimate of how many innocent, \\nlaw-abiding Americans' communications are getting swept up in \\nthis collection. Will you commit to getting this number to this \\ncommittee and the public before reauthorization?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes, I do. I'm going to do everything I can \\nto work with Admiral Rogers in NSA to get you that number. I've \\nbeen told it is an extremely complex process for a number of \\nreasons. As I said, without a classification I don't know what \\nall these reasons are. I need to learn what they are, but I \\nalso need to share with Admiral Rogers the need, I think, to \\nget this committee not just those numbers, but all the \\ninformation they need with which to make a judgment as to the \\nreauthorization.\\n    The intelligence community believes that the \\nreauthorization is extremely important; it's a program that has \\nprovided a significant amount of intelligence relative to what \\nforeign agents or individuals are trying to do to harm \\nAmericans. So it has layers of oversight at all three levels of \\ngovernment. It has been examined by the PCLOB, the Privacy and \\nCivil Liberties Oversight Board, and supported by the FISA \\nCourt.\\n    But this is something that you will be going through during \\nthis next year and we want to make sure you have all the \\ninformation you feel you need in order to make whatever \\nadjustments that Congress decides to make.\\n    Senator Wyden. So you'll commit to making sure we have the \\nnumber of innocent Americans being swept up before \\nreauthorization. Will you commit to declassifying any secret \\nlegal interpretations related to FISA as well?\\n    Senator Coats. Well, that's something that I'll have to \\ncontinue to work with you on. Obviously, I'm going to commit to \\ndo everything I can to try to get you that number. I need to \\nfind out why it has taken so long and what are the \\ncomplications in getting that number. But I think it's \\nimportant for the committee----\\n    Senator Wyden. This is declassification as well as the \\nnumber.\\n    Senator Coats. But on the declassification, as long as it \\ndoesn't--I mean, the declassification process is in place so \\nthat we can, if there are sensitive sources and methods that \\ncan be exposed, that have negative consequences to our \\nintelligence agency, we obviously have to classify those. But \\nthose that we can declassify, for the needed purpose, I think \\nwe need to do.\\n    Senator Wyden. Mr. Chairman, if I could just take a few \\nmore seconds, as you did.\\n    My point is--and I appreciate what Senator Coats is trying \\nto say here--A, we need that number. We have sought it for \\nyears and years. More and more Americans are getting swept up \\nin these searches. We're trying to legitimately go after \\nforeign targets that are a threat to us, but as \\ntelecommunications systems become globally integrated we're \\ngetting more and more law-abiding Americans swept up.\\n    So we need that. We need declassification. I look forward \\nto working with you.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Collins.\\n    Senator Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Welcome back, Senator Coats. We're delighted to see you.\\n    As the author, along with former Senator Joe Lieberman, of \\nthe 2004 law that created the Director of National \\nIntelligence, I have a special interest in your nomination. I'm \\ndelighted that the President has chosen you for this important \\nposition and I believe that he could not have made a better \\nchoice.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Senator Collins. I want to talk to you about the importance \\nof the DNI serving, as the law provides, as the principal \\nintelligence adviser to the President. I'm concerned about \\nreports that the President is changing the composition of the \\nso-called Principals Committee on the National Security Council \\nby adding his chief strategist and downgrading, or so it \\nappears, the role of the Director of National Intelligence.\\n    How will you ensure that you can fulfill the statutory \\nmandate to serve as the President's top intelligence adviser at \\nNational Security Council meetings if this proposed \\nreorganization goes forward?\\n    Senator Coats. That's a question that I have been \\naddressing directly with the President and his staff. I was \\ninformed that the drafting of that executive order was not \\nintended to not have the Director of National Intelligence as \\npart of the Principals Committee. It was drafted before--by \\nPresident Bush's administration, before the DNI was even stood \\nup. And so they took language from that, never intending not to \\nhave the DNI be a part of the Principals Committee.\\n    I have been reassured time and time and time again from the \\nPresident to his advisers that I'm welcome and needed and \\nexpected to be a part of the Principals Committee. It's \\nessential to the process of being in a position to know what is \\nmoving on up to the National Security Council relative to the \\nteam.\\n    I have great confidence in General McMaster in terms of his \\nputting together a team that he knows will be the most \\neffective NSC team that he can. And I think relative to who is \\nadded or not added to that team will be under his jurisdiction \\nand that, as I said, I have very great confidence that he is \\ngoing to put that team in place that he thinks can best serve \\nthe President.\\n    Senator Collins. Thank you. That's very reassuring, since I \\ncan't imagine having the Deputy DNI on the Deputies Committee \\nand then not having the DNI on the Principals Committee, which \\nmeets to resolve issues that are of the highest level that the \\ndeputies could not resolve. And surely the President should \\nwant to have his principal adviser on intelligence matters \\npresent at those very important meetings.\\n    Senator Coats. And I was ensured that that was the intent \\nand the other was just a mischaracterization of the Executive \\nOrder.\\n    Senator Collins. Thank you.\\n    A second issue that I want it raise with you is that \\nPresident Trump has asked an individual who runs a private \\nequity firm to lead a broad review of the U.S. intelligence \\nagencies. As far as I can tell, this individual does not have \\nnational security experience, nor does he appear to have \\nexperience in intelligence.\\n    As you're well aware, the President can already receive \\nindependent advice from the President's Intelligence Advisory \\nBoard, which can provide outside advice regarding a full range \\nof intelligence activities. So to have this additional review, \\nparticularly from an individual who does not appear to have the \\nrequisite background, appears to be a textbook definition of \\nwaste and duplication.\\n    In addition, in your statement you talked very eloquently \\nabout the responsibility the DNI has to bring the intelligence \\nagencies together to review, to make sure they are working \\neffectively and efficiently. My concern is that an outside \\nreview by an individual without experience can result in \\nrecommendations that are essentially armchair quarterbacking of \\nthe leadership of the intelligence community.\\n    Do you view it as your job to review the operations of the \\nintelligence community?\\n    Senator Coats. I do, and I've made that clear to the \\nPresident and to his advisers, that that is where I stand. \\nClearly, as I said in my opening statement, every agency needs \\nto consciously review itself, particularly at a time when \\nbudget resources are restrained--well, at any time, whether \\nthey are or not. We want an efficient and effective government, \\nstreamlined to efficiency.\\n    But in terms of looking at that and assigning someone to \\nthat position, if it involves the intelligence community, I \\nthink that it needs to be under my authority. And I've made \\nthat very, very clear. And I believe that's what the case will \\nbe.\\n    Now, I know Mr. Feinberg personally. I think he's a \\npatriot. He wants to serve his country and he brings many \\ntalents to that. But I do not think that translates into \\nreporting to the White House and not being under the control of \\nthe Director--excuse me--the national security office. Sorry, \\nthe DNI. I ought to have that down pretty well, don't you \\nthink, the DNI?\\n    So I want to just assure you that that's an issue that I \\nhave been engaged in and I have full confidence that that's the \\nway it will turn out.\\n    Senator Collins. Thank you very much and I wish you all the \\nbest.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Heinrich.\\n    Senator Heinrich. Welcome back, Dan.\\n    Chairman Burr. Thank you.\\n    Senator Heinrich. I want to go back to a couple of--some of \\nthe ground that Senator Collins covered. I think most of us \\nagree with your analogy. We want you to be the head coach. \\nWe're a little concerned that sometimes the owner of the team \\nmight rather hear from the offensive coordinator right now. So \\nsome of these things with regard to the executive order, with \\nregard to Mr. Feinberg of Cerberus, the appointment of the \\nDirector of the CIA to the committee, they open a lot of \\nquestions for how you're going to maintain the DNI's leadership \\nrole and the structure that has served the intelligence \\ncommunity so well, after a period when we really realized \\nstovepipes do not help American national security.\\n    So I want to make sure I understand what you said to \\nSenator Collins. Do I understand that the Executive Order that \\ncame out, that seemed to remove the DNI from the Principals \\nCommittee, was a recycled Bush administration Executive Order \\nthat just didn't reflect current law and historical precedent \\nfrom 2002?\\n    Senator Coats. That's my understanding. I wasn't there, of \\ncourse, at the time, in the writing of that. I had no \\nparticipation in that. That is my understanding. I cannot fully \\nsay that that's what exactly happened, but what has been told \\nto me is that the intent was never to not have the DNI as part \\nof the Principals Committee, and they reassured me very quickly \\nthat, look--they also were thinking there may be occasion when \\nthe committee is meeting dealing with something that doesn't \\ninvolve intelligence, perhaps a flood or something like that.\\n    Senator Heinrich. I don't think we need to be worried about \\nthat sort of a situation. I think we do want to be reassured--\\none, I'm reassured with regard to your position. I think that's \\nvery important. I am not reassured as to the process that these \\nExecutive Orders have been going through, given what I see as a \\npretty enormous omission.\\n    Let me move on to another issue with regard to encryption, \\nand we've had this conversation a lot when you were here on the \\ncommittee. It's something you're going to have to deal with, a \\nvery evolving situation moving forward. NSA Director Admiral \\nRogers called encryption ``foundational to the future.'' I \\nthink Secretary Carter called encryption ``absolutely \\nessential'' with regard to the Department of Defense, and he \\nsaid, quote, ``I'm not a believer in back doors or a single \\ntechnical approach to what is a complex and complicated \\nproblem. I'm just not. I don't think that's realistic. I don't \\nthink that's technically accurate.'' End quote.\\n    Other former IC leaders--Michael Hayden, Mike McConnell, \\nMichael Chertoff, Mike Morrell--a lot of Michaels--have all \\nmade public statements of strong support for strong encryption \\nand unequivocal opposition to so-called back doors because of \\nthe risks inherent to them.\\n    Do you believe that strong encryption is an essential tool \\nfor the American public and private sectors to be able to \\nprotect personal, business, financial data from hackers, \\ncriminals, and malicious governments?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes, I do, and I think it's important, \\nobviously, for the government, all government entities. We're \\nall aware of the attempts to break into systems that deal with \\nour defense, deal with our financial resources, deal with any \\nnumber of things. So encryption has a very positive effect and \\nis needed.\\n    We also have, though, the responsibility of trying to \\nunderstand what those who are not using the Internet for the \\nright purposes--we used to be separated by two wide oceans and \\nfelt we were pretty safe and we could always be ready for \\nsomething that was coming our way. Now, in fractions of a \\nsecond someone can hit a key and cause incredible damage to the \\nUnited States in many, many ways, all across the spectrum.\\n    So there are those occasions, I think, when we need to at \\nleast think about, when we have legal authority to address a \\nsituation where we need to get information, cooperation from \\nthe public sector would be helpful. I think that conversation \\nhas been going on, needs to continue going on.\\n    You know, the CEOs of companies that are making devices and \\nguaranteeing their buyers encryption, they worry about their \\nfamilies, they worry about their communities, they worry about \\nattacks on the United States. So once again, I'm not in a \\npolicy position to decide how this happens, but I do think that \\nit needs to be an ongoing discussion among policymakers in \\nterms of what legal authorities. In the end, we follow the law, \\nwhatever it is, regardless of our personal opinions.\\n    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Chairman.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Blunt.\\n    Senator Blunt. Well, it's great to have you back and great \\nto have been on this committee with you and know that you have \\nan important and in many ways unique sense of these issues. But \\nalso, we've watched as a committee and as a Congress the DNI \\noperation grow beyond what at least I initially thought it \\nwould be. And I'm wondering, as you've had a chance to think \\nabout this, why you think that has happened and how much of it \\nis a result of the Congress taxing the DNI with specific \\nassignments rather than letting the DNI decide which agency \\nshould have that assignment?\\n    Give me a sense of how you think that's developed and how \\nyour review of the other agencies would also involve the review \\nof what the Director of National Intelligence and that entire \\noperation under your daily management would look like?\\n    Senator Coats. Well, I've been asking the same question of \\nthe IC in regards to this. I have found that statutory \\nrequirements, Executive Orders, directives, have added \\nfunctions to the DNI that are mandated by the Congress or by \\nthe Executive Branch.\\n    Also, I think people don't understand that NCTC is a part \\nof the DNI. They have about 750 employees at the NCTC. I don't \\nhear anybody calling for not having an NCTC, but by statute \\nunder IRTPA it was made part of the DNI. We have rotations that \\ncome. I think about 40 percent of the people there are rotated \\nthrough.\\n    It's much like what the military has tried to do with their \\njoint exercises and so forth. They want Navy to serve with the \\nArmy at a certain point and the Air Force at a certain point so \\nthat they are familiar with the whole and can perform better \\nservice, they're not stovepiped. And it's somewhat similar to \\nwhat the whole joint efforts under Goldwater-Nichols was trying \\nto accomplish.\\n    So it's a little more complicated than just more than just \\nthe number, oh, there's 1,750 people out there, why do we need \\nthat many? It's those two factors that played a major role in \\nthat.\\n    Having said that, it doesn't mean that we can't take a hard \\nlook at that: How can we streamline? How can we be more \\neffective? But simply taking a number of people here and \\nputting them over there really doesn't change the dynamic if \\nthe reason that they're here is for integration processes, \\ncoordinating processes, and so forth.\\n    So to finish my remarks, simply, if you're going to \\nintegrate information that is coming from 16 other different \\nagencies, you have to have members there from some of those \\nfunctions that know what's coming from their function so that \\nthey can be part of the integration solution.\\n    Senator Blunt. And do you think the Congress has rightly or \\nwrongly created all those specific assignments for the DNI, as \\nopposed to either letting the DNI determine who had the \\nassignment or making an assignment to one of the specific \\nagencies and knowing that the DNI would be--have oversight?\\n    Senator Coats. That's probably a good question to ask \\nSenator Collins. I know her initial intent, along with Senator \\nLieberman and others that put this together, had to work \\nthrough the process of becoming law. I read an interesting book \\nabout what that two and half years was like in order to achieve \\nthat.\\n    Many times we have a vision here and we have our staff \\nwrite it up into law and from the starting point to the ending \\npoint we don't sometimes recognize it when it comes back with \\nall the decisions that have been made make adjustments so \\ncertain entities have this authority and that authority. So \\nthere is some fog in the air about the exact authorities of the \\nDNI and the responsibilities that are left to other agencies. \\nClearly, an overseer, someone who has some defined authorities, \\nbut not necessarily the authority to simply go into every \\nagency and deal with their operations.\\n    Senator Blunt. I would just conclude by saying on this \\ntopic, I think nobody is in a better position to work with the \\nrelevant committees of Congress to try to go back now and take \\na look at that law, what it was intended to do, whether it \\nreally has achieved what it was intended to do, and the advice \\nyou might have as you have a chance to look at this from both \\nperspectives of what the next DNI might be able to deal with \\nbecause of reforms and efficiencies that you built in while \\nhave you this job. And I look forward to you being part of this \\ncommittee's activities for the next several years.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you. Well, it's 12 years on and it's \\nprobably time to take a look at it and say, as I said, what \\nworks, what doesn't and why, and what changes can we make to \\nmake it be better.\\n    Senator Blunt. Exactly, and I'd like for that to be one of \\nthe things that you determine is going to be one of your major \\ngoals.\\n    Senator Coats. That is one of my major goals.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator King.\\n    Senator King. Thank you.\\n    Senator Coats, I would first take issue with your analogy. \\nI can assure you that the assistant coaches of the New England \\nPatriots would be astonished to think that Bill Belicheck is as \\npassive as you would portray him. You've got to be more \\naggressive. This isn't a passive role, Senator.\\n    Let me move on to my only concern about your nomination. \\nYou're one of the most likable, affable, easy-going people I've \\never met. I liked traveling with you and working with you on \\nthis committee. I'm not sure likability and affability are the \\nqualities I want in this position. I want somebody who is \\ncrusty and mean and tough, because you're riding herd on 17 \\nagencies that will always want to be going in different \\ndirections and you're going to be reporting to a President who \\nmay or may not want to hear what you have to say.\\n    Can you assure me that, not only are you changing hats when \\nyou go into this job, but you're going to be hard in terms of \\nyour execution of this I think the second most important job in \\nthe United States Government right now?\\n    Senator Coats. Well, achieving the level of Bill Belicheck \\nmay be tough. I haven't seen any other NFL coaches that achieve \\nthe level of Bill Belicheck.\\n    Senator King. In attitude and success.\\n    Senator Coats. But I hear exactly what you're saying, and I \\nthink the office demands it and I think the times demand it. \\nClearly, we are in a situation--we're not in a passive \\nsituation from a world threats standpoint. It has reached the \\nlevel that we can't afford not to go at this with everything \\nthat we have.\\n    Senator King. To put a point on this, the three most \\nserious foreign policy mistakes in my lifetime are the Bay of \\nPigs, Vietnam, and the invasion of Iraq. All of those were \\nbased upon configuring intelligence to meet the desires of the \\npolicymakers. That's the common thread that runs through.\\n    The pressure on you to try to meet the demands of the \\npolicymakers--and it just happened on Saturday when allegedly \\nthe Trump Administration, the White House, put pressure on the \\nDepartment of Homeland Security Intelligence and Analysis to \\ncome up with a justification for the travel ban. Rather than \\nasking, what's the story on people from these countries, they \\ngave them the answer and said, give us the evidence.\\n    Have you heard about this incident? It just was reported \\nthis past weekend.\\n    Senator Coats. I read that in public media, yes.\\n    Senator King. Does that concern you?\\n    Senator Coats. As I said in the beginning and as I will say \\nfrequently to both the President and to the Executive Branch, \\nyou need to fully understand my role. My role is to provide you \\nwith the intelligence to formulate policy, not formulate \\npolicy, not be a spokesman for any political decisions that are \\nmade.\\n    So yes, I have made this clear. I will continue to make \\nthis clear. I cannot go outside the bounds of my authorities, \\nand I believe those authorities require me to do nothing less \\nthan what I just said.\\n    Senator King. A quick yes or no question: Do you need this \\njob?\\n    Senator Coats. No, I don't need this job. One of the \\nbenefits of being in your generation together, I think, as I \\nlook at the panel here----\\n    Senator King. I don't know what you're talking about.\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    That's the right answer.\\n    Senator Coats. You and I go back all the way to the Bay of \\nPigs and all the way to Vietnam. And if we didn't learn \\nanything from these incidents, then shame on us.\\n    Senator King. That's right, and I want you to, because \\nthere is going to be a moment when you're going to have to say: \\nI don't need this job, because I'm being asked to do something \\nthat I shouldn't do. I'm not predicting that that will happen, \\nbut very well that could happen.\\n    It's happened, and this isn't about this President or any \\nother President. It's happened, as we've both pointed out, over \\nthe past 40 years.\\n    A couple of follow-up questions on the National Security \\nCouncil. I don't know where the language came from, but the \\nlanguage says that where instances--you're invited where \\ninstances pertaining to the DNI's responsibility and expertise \\nare to be discussed. I can't imagine a situation where that \\nwouldn't be the case.\\n    I'm worried that you said, well, if it's a problem we'll \\nfix it. It should be fixed now. You shouldn't be welcome at \\nthese meetings; you should be part of these meetings. I would \\nurge you to talk to the White House about this Executive Order \\nthat was issued barely a week after the President was in \\noffice, about correcting that fault.\\n    The second fault in that was to put Steve Bannon, the \\nPresident's political adviser, onto the National Security \\nCouncil. I understand that President Bush forbade Karl Rove \\nfrom even going to National Security Council meetings, let \\nalone being on it. And I hope you will go back and take that \\nmessage.\\n    Admiral Mullen says this is politicizing intelligence or \\nnational security from the beginning, and I think that's a very \\nbad practice.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you, Senator. I'll take that message \\nback to the President.\\n    Senator King. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Rubio.\\n    Senator Rubio. Thank you.\\n    It's great to see you, Dan. Just to Senator King's concern, \\nI sat next to you here for a couple of years and I found you to \\nactually be quite an unpleasant human being on many occasions.\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    Senator Rubio. Of course, everyone who knows you knows that \\nthat's not true. But we're fortunate and grateful at your \\nwillingness to continue to serve our country.\\n    There are three topics I wanted to touch. The first is kind \\nof this unusual situation that we now have regarding \\ncounterintelligence in particular, and it's the sort of synergy \\nthat combines the strategic placement of illegally accessed \\ninformation, the use of media organisms under the control of \\nforeign governments, RT and Sputnik and the like. There's \\nalways been an element of propaganda involved in politics, but \\nthe sort of synergy between propaganda, counterintelligence, \\nfor purposes of interfering, influencing, and manipulating, \\ndirecting elections, policymaking in foreign countries, I think \\nhas reached a level in many places in Europe and I believe in \\nthe United States that's unique.\\n    I just wanted to--and you may have touched on this earlier, \\nbut this is a challenge that is perhaps a bit different from \\nwhat we have been dealing with in the intelligence community \\nover the last decade, certainly since post-9/11. That is, not \\njust that foreign governments have intelligence agencies that \\ntarget us, but that in fact they strategically use information \\npotentially to have an influence over our policymakers, our \\npolicymaking, and potentially even our elections.\\n    So that new dynamic; how do you view the multiple different \\nagencies kind of synergizing all of that to confront this new \\nelement that I still think we're grappling with fully \\nunderstanding?\\n    Senator Coats. I did mention earlier that the advances in \\ntechnology have upped the games of those who want to use these \\ntechniques, and the connection of the world and the links \\nthrough the worldwide Internet have been marvelous advances for \\nmankind, but have extreme vulnerabilities also and can be taken \\nadvantage of.\\n    I think we need to educate our public to the fact that \\nthese types of things are happening, so that in their factoring \\nin terms of their decisions relative to government and \\ngovernment's functions and elections and so forth they're well \\naware of the fact that they can't just simply believe \\neverything they hear and everything they read, that there are \\nthese efforts out there to undermine who we are as a country, \\nundermine some of our values, cause us to lose confidence in \\nour government's ability to protect our privacy, et cetera.\\n    So I do think that requires much more agility, much better \\nmeans of not only intercepting these, but putting not only the \\ndefenses in place, but offenses, a response, so that those that \\nare doing this know there's a consequence to what they're \\ndoing.\\n    Senator Rubio. I would just add that, given the fact that \\nthis kind of touches upon the intelligence community so \\nheavily, there's always this tension between allowing the \\nAmerican public and, for that matter, our allies to understand \\nwhat's happening and yet allowing the intelligence community to \\ncontinue to work in ways that do not divulge more than is \\nnecessary. That tension is always there and I think it's an \\nimportant part of the element that we should take into account \\nmoving forward.\\n    I really do think in many ways one of the greatest defenses \\ntowards any efforts to interfere with our political process \\nfrom outside the country would be to allow the American people \\nto be aware as much as possible of what those efforts entail, \\nso that they understand the source and the motivation behind \\nthings that they may be reading, seeing, et cetera, throughout \\nthe process.\\n    So I'm glad to hear you mention that. I think that will be \\na big challenge for the entire intelligence community and I \\nthink you'll have a key role to play in synergizing that across \\nall the difficult agencies that serve us in that regard.\\n    The second issue I want to talk to you about is our \\ndetention policy. I'm troubled by the direction it's taken. We \\nknow for a fact and you've seen in open source reporting that a \\nnumber of former Gitmo detainees have gone on to rejoin the \\nfight against us. American citizens have been killed. Others \\nare still out there fighting against us now.\\n    What is your view of our detention policy at the end of the \\nlast Administration and do you have any views now about what \\nyou would advise the President in terms of how we should--what \\nour detention policy for terrorists and enemy combatants should \\nbe in the new Administration?\\n    Senator Coats. I've had the opportunity to travel with \\nSenator Burr and other members of the committee, with Senator \\nBurr leading our contingent and before him Senator Chambliss \\nand Senator Feinstein. These questions have been asked of \\nintelligence agencies in terms of what has happened to those \\nthat have been released from Guantanamo? Are they running a \\nStarbucks in Yemen or have they rejoined the fight?\\n    A significant percentage of those have rejoined the fight. \\nSo I know we have a high-value target individual team in place \\nthat can look at this situation and make these determinations \\nas to who may or may not be released. But this is an ongoing \\nconflict and the last thing we want to do is tell the American \\npeople that we're sending somebody back in to become once again \\nour adversary.\\n    So I've been supporting that detention, which I think is \\ndone in a lawful way, done in a humane way. But simply sending \\neverybody back home I don't think is a solution to the problem.\\n    Senator Rubio. I know I'm out of time. Just a point of \\nclarification. Number one, I believe the last Starbucks in \\nYemen closed last week and so that--but on a serious matter, \\nRobert Levinson, who is a former FBI agent, disappeared from \\nKish Island, Iran, in 2007. He is believed widely to be held by \\nIran, by elements of the Iranian government. His family are \\nfrom Florida and I would just ask in your new role that you \\npledge to do everything possible to help locate Bob and help \\nbring him home.\\n    Senator Coats. Yes, in my closing months in the Senate I \\nwas also advised of someone else who was put in a similar \\nsituation, this one in Turkey. And our office has been working \\nto try to determine what the basis of this was and to get him \\nreleased. So I'm well aware of the situation from a personal \\nbasis in terms of our needing to address these issues.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Manchin.\\n    Senator Manchin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Thank you again, Senator. It's great serving with you, Dan, \\nand great to have you back.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you, Joe.\\n    Senator Manchin. That being said, there's been some tough \\nquestioning here and there's a lot of concern. We're in a \\ndifficult time and period of our life with this Intel \\nCommittee. I'm new to this committee, so I'm learning it as \\nquickly as I can. But I think people are depending on us. I \\nknow that Senator King and myself and Senator Harris and I, \\nbeing the newest members on this side of the aisle, we're \\ntrying to get up to speed as quickly as possible.\\n    I think I would first ask--I think the question was asked \\nyou by our Ranking Member about would you be able to turn over \\nthe information and make sure we had access to the information. \\nYou said that was your intent. Do you have the authority to \\nmake--if we're getting what we consider slow-rolled, do you \\nhave that authority to make sure that we're able to have that \\naccess, whether it be any one of the 17 agencies, that we need \\nto conduct a full investigation?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes. I hope I said more than intent. That's \\nmy authority. That's my obligation.\\n    Senator Manchin. Do you have the----\\n    Senator Coats. Timely is part of the equation here and it \\nneeds to be given to you completely, timely, unvarnished.\\n    Senator Manchin. So we can count on that, basically?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes, you can.\\n    Senator Manchin. Right now a lot of people are frustrated.\\n    Senator Coats. Yes, you can.\\n    Senator Manchin. I want to make sure.\\n    Senator Coats. I have no intention of holding anything back \\nfrom this committee, the access to this committee that they \\nneed.\\n    Senator Manchin. Senator, the other question I would ask is \\nthat--when I look back at 2004 when the DNI was created, what \\ndo you think the purpose was? Who lost faith? Who lost \\nconfidence? Why did we think we needed a DNI to be formed? Have \\nyou evaluated that?\\n    Senator Coats. Well, I have done some evaluation and some \\nreading and some discussions with the members, some of those \\nwho were part of that process from the beginning. I served both \\nwith Senator Lieberman and, obviously, with Senator Collins, \\nand I know their role in this, and others.\\n    Senator Manchin. We didn't reduce any of the 17 agencies. \\nWe still have the same 17 agencies.\\n    Senator Coats. What was happening, there was the so-called \\nstovepipe process. They weren't sharing information with each \\nother the way that they should. There was no way to integrate \\nit. Everybody put out their own. Some of it was dismissed, some \\nof it, well, we have more faith in this agency than that \\nagency. You didn't get a complete picture.\\n    I kind of view this as building, making a puzzle, and \\nyou've got 17 pieces that all need to come together. You want \\nthe input from those 17 to be put in the right place, but you \\nwant that all to come together into one picture. There will be \\nsome dissenting views in there, yes. If there are dissenting \\nviews from this agency or that agency or the different views \\nabout the confidence level of what the intelligence is, you \\nneed to know that.\\n    But what the committee needs to know and what the President \\nand the customers in the Executive Branch need to know is that \\nto the best of our ability this integrated intelligence is \\nprovided to you by all the 17 agencies pulling together every \\nlittle piece of that puzzle.\\n    Senator Manchin. Do you think the 17 agencies believe that \\nyou have the authority or the DNI has that authority to remove \\nthem, remove that director or take it extremely strongly by the \\nPresident for that person to be removed if they're not doing \\ntheir job?\\n    Senator Coats. Well, taking to the President, these are \\nPresidentially appointed positions.\\n    Senator Manchin. What I'm saying is, do they look at the \\nDNI as having that authority, that really that's who they're \\nanswering to, that's their boss?\\n    Senator Coats. Well, there's collaboration authority and \\nthere's other authorities. We had a discussion of that a little \\nbit earlier about the initial views of those who are putting it \\ntogether or for various reasons modified it as it moved through \\nthe legislative process, or with the Executive Branch coming in \\nand making recommendations.\\n    Senator Manchin. Do you think in that position, the DNI, \\nthat with all of the additional news media, the 24-hour news \\ncycle we have, the social media, everything that's going on \\ntoday on the internet, the so-called ``fake news,'' if you \\nwill, do you think the DNI has a responsibility to speak up and \\nsay, this is a bunch of hogwash, there's no credibility to this \\nwhatsoever, for the American public to figure out what's real \\nand what's not real?\\n    Senator Coats. Well, we have a role, a role to provide \\nintelligence. But making decisions relative to policy--and we \\ncan make analysis to provide to you, to provide to our \\npolicymakers. But it was mentioned earlier, truth to power. Our \\njob is to provide the truth, and power goes to those people who \\nare in a position to make those determinations, make policy, \\nmake corrections, make laws, et cetera. That's what we bring to \\nyou, not that--we're not spokesmen.\\n    Senator Manchin. You don't believe that basically, on the \\nso-called New York Times article, that whether, what side \\npeople might be on--that there should be any clarity coming \\nfrom the DNI?\\n    Senator Coats. We provide that information. I don't \\nenvision myself as going on CNN every night and saying, here's \\nwhat we've done. I envision providing that information to the \\npolicymakers to let them make that decision.\\n    Senator Manchin. Dan, one final question. Many leaders have \\nidentified Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and ISIS as the \\ntop security threats to the United States. Have you chosen one \\nwho you think is our top security threat?\\n    Senator Coats. It's kind of an ``all of above'' category \\nhere, I think, given the diversity of threats that we have. I \\nmentioned earlier on that cyber has moved very quickly, I \\nthink, to the top in terms of--because it affects almost \\neverything we do in this country in terms of people's safety, \\nin terms of financial, commercial, our national defense, \\nintellectual property, and on and on you can go.\\n    Senator Manchin. Is one most capable that you're concerned \\nabout?\\n    Senator Coats. You know, I would like to take that to the \\nclosed session. I have some strong thoughts about that, but I \\nthink that could potentially turn into something we need to do \\nin the closed session.\\n    Senator Manchin. That's fair. Thank you so much, and thank \\nyou for your continued service----\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Senator Manchin [continuing]. And willingness to serve.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Lankford.\\n    Senator Lankford. Dan, it's absolutely great to see you \\nagain. I'm sure you're enjoying being on that side of the desk, \\nbecause you can't get up and leave when you need to or be able \\nto come in and out or take a quick phone call. You're stuck \\nright there.\\n    Senator Coats. Yes.\\n    Senator Lankford. So it really is great to see you.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Senator Lankford. I do want to follow up on a conversation \\nthat Senator King had with you. I would say I had the same line \\nof questioning for you that I just want to be able to close the \\nloop on. You're one of the nicest people I've ever met.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Senator Lankford. And that is to your credit, not only to \\nyour faith and your family, but the people you've served for a \\nlong time. But I really want the DNI to be able to be tough \\nwhen it requires to be tough and to be clear when it's time to \\nbe clear, because the policymakers around you need clarity, \\nneed straightforward facts, need the facts that they know that \\nthey can trust. And we'll deal with nice in the hallway when we \\ncan grab a bottle of water together and get a chance to chit-\\nchat.\\n    But I need to hear a clarification from you again that when \\nthe moment comes and it's crunch time you can be as tough as \\nyou need to be.\\n    Senator Coats. James, I think that's--Senator. I'm sorry.\\n    Senator Lankford. ``James'' is always good.\\n    Senator Coats. You said such nice things about me, I just \\nfell into our friendship.\\n    Senator, I absolutely understand that this role demands \\nsomeone who can stand up to the pressures that will be placed \\nupon him, political pressures. When you have 17 agencies, not \\neverybody's going to agree in terms of the way to go forward, \\nand there needs to be a Director who can assert that authority.\\n    I've been blessed, I have Mary Scott who backs me up with \\ngood wise counsel. But I recognize the need for that. Given the \\nsituation that we are facing worldwide in terms of these \\nthreats, we don't have time just to be the nice guy. We've got \\nto go after it.\\n    Senator Lankford. I have often said to people in my state \\nthat challenge me for being too nice at times, I say I can say \\n``No'' with a smile still, but still be able to stand by it. \\nAnd I know you can as well. But that'll be an area you're \\npushed on.\\n    But I'll also say to you that some of the pressure won't \\njust be from the policymakers around you. There is a tendency \\nwith all of us in the political world, as well as with the \\nintelligence community, to somewhat chase the priorities of the \\nheadline, of the latest news story, and that becomes the IC \\npriority.\\n    For many in the IC community, they saw the cyber issue a \\nlong time ago. The media is only recently catching up to the \\nreal threats that we face on cyber. So one of the things that \\nwe will need from you in the days ahead is to keep the agencies \\non focus to where the real threats are, not just where the \\nheadlines are. A good for-instance of this is, it's amazing to \\nme how little we talk about narco-terrorism any more and we \\nhave tens of thousands of people who die through either the \\ntrafficking, the individuals, of drugs, or from overdoses as a \\nresult of that, that are Americans dying all the time. It's one \\nof the constant threats that we have, but the news doesn't talk \\nabout it much any more and so it somewhat drifts to the \\nbackground.\\n    You have the responsibility to be able to make sure it \\ndoesn't drift to the background among our intelligence \\ncommunity, that we stay on focus on the threats that we face \\nall the time, and that when the issues come up we're on top of \\nthem.\\n    Let me ask a strange question for us. When we get a chance \\nto visit together, will we still be able to talk about the \\n``Coats Waste of the Week''? Will you still be focused in on \\n``I found an area that we need to resolve''? You know as well \\nas all of us do on this dais that at times working with the \\nAdministration, if there are things that need to be fixed, \\nthere is some other entity that sees it, but the practitioners \\nin the agency actually see the problem. We need help in the \\noversight part of it, that when you see something in any of the \\n17 entities or your own office, can you help us be able to see \\nsome of those things as well, to be able to know what to fix \\nlegislatively?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes, I intend to do that. I went with some \\npassion every week to the Senate floor 55 times to address a \\n``Certified Waste of the Week.'' I've already looked around a \\nlittle bit and said maybe that fits the ``Waste of the Week'' \\ncategory, let's investigate that. Obviously, I would have to be \\nconfirmed before I could start that process. But I'm committed \\nto doing that.\\n    I want to just reflect basically on what you said about the \\nnarco-terrorism. You and I have talked about this personally. I \\nthink each of us has experienced talking to families who \\ntragically have lost a member of that family because of--maybe \\na 17-year-old going to a party and somebody says, ``Here, try \\nthis,'' and they end up in the hospital and many of them \\nperish.\\n    It is a scourge that is cutting across every part of our \\ncountry. We have it in Indiana. You have it in your state and \\nevery one of our members has it. It is something that can't be \\nignored or pushed aside. It is undermining the very essence of \\nthis country and it's affecting families and communities in \\nways that haven't made the headlines as much as they should. \\nBut it has to be a component of this, and intelligence does \\nplay a role in terms of how these things are brought into our \\ncountry or within our country manufactured.\\n    Senator Lankford. Thanks, Dan.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Harris.\\n    Senator Harris. Senator Coats, I enjoyed our time together \\nand thank you for that.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you. I did also.\\n    Senator Harris. I noted many of my colleagues have raised \\nthe issue of the restructuring of the National Security \\nCouncil. I'd like to talk about that a little bit more, because \\nI'm sure you agree it's critically important as it relates to \\nwhat we need to accomplish in terms of national security.\\n    As has been mentioned, the President's Executive Order was \\nissued on January 28th, which basically put the Director of \\nNational Intelligence in a place where he or you, if confirmed, \\nwould not be included necessarily in the National Security \\nCouncil meetings and the Principals Committee meetings. If \\nconfirmed as the Director of National Intelligence, do you \\nbelieve that it's critically important that you have a \\npermanent role in those meetings?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes.\\n    Senator Harris. And have you requested of the President or \\nany member of his Administration that that Executive Order be \\nmodified?\\n    Senator Coats. We have sent them information as to how to \\nmodify it. It has not been addressed yet, but I have been \\nreassured over and over and over by the President and his staff \\nthat absolutely that's what their intent was and they expect me \\nto be there.\\n    Senator Harris. Have they given you a date of when it will \\nbe modified?\\n    Senator Coats. They have not given me a date.\\n    Senator Harris. Is it going to happen before your \\nconfirmation?\\n    Senator Coats. They have not given me a date and I can't \\nanswer--I do not know of a particular date.\\n    Senator Harris. Now, my understanding is that the CIA \\nDirector was--that the Executive Order was modified on January \\n30th.\\n    Senator Coats. Correct.\\n    Senator Harris. And it was modified to include the CIA \\nDirector; is that correct?\\n    Senator Coats. That's correct.\\n    Senator Harris. Okay. So you mentioned earlier that the \\nExecutive Order was basically something from the Bush era that \\nhad been resuscitated. But it has been modified since it was \\nissued; you agree to that, is that correct?\\n    Senator Coats. I think it was the 30th. I need to----\\n    Senator Harris. Well, it's been modified since it was \\nissued under this Administration?\\n    Senator Coats. No, it has not been modified.\\n    Senator Harris. So when was the CIA Director added to that?\\n    Senator Coats. That was part of the original.\\n    Senator Harris. No, it wasn't.\\n    Senator Coats. Okay. It was a press conference statement. \\nIt was not an action that was taken.\\n    Senator Harris. Okay, because I have a copy of that here \\nand it was added back to the National Security Council. So the \\npoint is that this Bush-era document has been modified since it \\nwas issued to include the CIA Director, but it did not put back \\nin DNI.\\n    Senator Coats. I may be wrong in saying it was a Bush-era.\\n    Senator Harris. You indicated that that's what the \\nAdministration told you.\\n    Senator Coats. I said my understanding was that language \\nwas taken from a similar Executive Order issued under the Bush \\nAdministration and that order was issued before there was a \\nposition of DNI. And I have been told verbally that the intent \\nwas not to leave the DNI's position off, just that someone \\ndrafting that language didn't realize that that language didn't \\ninclude the DNI because there was no DNI at that particular \\npoint in time.\\n    But the bottom line is, the bottom line is is that I have \\nfull, 100 percent confidence that I will be part of the \\nPrincipals Committee. Yes----\\n    Senator Harris. Well, my concern is not about--on this \\npoint, not about your qualifications. My concern is about what \\nenvironment you're walking into, and in particular whether, if \\nconfirmed, you will actually have a seat in that body. And if \\nthe Administration is telling you that it was some document \\nthat was issued in a time gone by, we know that it has since \\nbeen modified to include the CIA, it did not include the Joint \\nChiefs, and it has not replaced the position for which you are \\nhere to testify.\\n    So my concern is that there has been no indication or \\nassurance given that you will, if confirmed, actually be a \\nmember of that body. And I'd like to know from you, if that \\ndoes not happen are you prepared to still assume the \\nresponsibilities without the authority that you would have if \\nyou were a member of that body?\\n    Senator Coats. I'm fully prepared to assume the \\nresponsibilities.\\n    Senator Harris. Even if you are--even if the Executive \\nOrder is not modified?\\n    Senator Coats. Yes, I am. I've been assured that I have the \\nauthority to be a member of that committee and be at that \\ncommittee in every one of its meetings.\\n    Senator Harris. Wouldn't you agree the assurance would be \\nsealed if the Executive Order is modified to indicate that the \\nposition that you now seek is actually entitled to be a part of \\nall meetings that relate to national security?\\n    Senator Coats. As I've indicated before, I'm going to take \\nthat message to the Administration that the question was raised \\nhere. I'm perfectly comfortable with it because I trust them \\nand I believe what they have told me and I intend to do this. \\nBut----\\n    Senator Harris. I would be concerned because they've----\\n    Senator Coats. I would like to get back to you----\\n    Senator Harris [continuing]. Also suggested that this came \\nfrom the Bush era and we know that there have been \\nmodifications since. I would be concerned.\\n    But I appreciate your service and your candor.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Senator Harris. Thank you.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Cotton.\\n    Senator Cotton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Thank you, Dan, for once again answering the call of \\nservice.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Senator Cotton. And Marsha, for once again standing beside \\nDan as he answers the call of service. It's good to see you \\nback here and I congratulate you on your nomination.\\n    We've spoken some about the unique challenges and \\nopportunities of trying to integrate all 17 agencies within the \\nintelligence community that you'll face as the DNI. You're \\nobviously very familiar with them. You're familiar with the \\nkind of intelligence products they each produce and the \\npriorities that they each have.\\n    Have you any thoughts on what actions can be taken in the \\nvery short run to make that process work more efficiently and \\nto produce a coherent picture for policymakers of what's \\nhappening in the world overseas in your role as DNI?\\n    Senator Coats. Obviously, there's a lot I need to learn. I \\nwant to get acquainted with the various leaders of the \\nagencies. But as I have said before, given the nature of the \\nthreats that we face, we need to act sooner rather than later. \\nI've always believed that getting the right people in place is \\nwhat can best execute the doctrine in terms of achieving the \\ngoals that you want to achieve. So we will quickly, if \\nconfirmed, move into that mode of filling that up.\\n    I did recognize earlier on the previous leaders of ODNI and \\nthe smooth transition that they have arranged by ensuring that \\nthere's continuity during this gap period of time. But this is \\none of--this rises to an early responsibility.\\n    Senator Cotton. One of the original purposes of the ODNI \\nwas to take the disparate kinds of intelligence that is \\ncollected by our intelligence agencies, be it human \\nintelligence, bank records, satellite imagery, email and \\ntelephone intercepts, passenger manifests, and synthesize them \\nall together to create a coherent picture. I think that's an \\nimportant function and it still can play that function and part \\ntoday.\\n    One thing I have heard on occasion from my visits to the \\nvarious agencies and talking with their front-line personnel is \\nthat the DNI over time has imposed bureaucratic mandates on the \\nagencies in reporting requirements, HR requirements, and so \\nforth, that get their core collectors or their analysts out of \\nthe business of core collection and analyzing and spend too \\nmuch of their time focused on fulfilling those bureaucratic \\nmandates.\\n    Have you seen that in your preparation and do you have any \\nthoughts about how you might focus the DNI on that original \\nmission and keep the constituent agencies of the IC focused on \\ntheir original mission?\\n    Senator Coats. Well, I haven't had enough experience to \\nevaluate that. I will certainly take that as an issue to \\naddress. But without the confirmation, I haven't had the \\nopportunity to engage with the other 16 agencies, except to \\nbegin to formulate some relationships with a few of them, \\nstarting with the Director of Central Intelligence. We've had a \\nnumber of occasions to talk to each other and share what we \\nthink the concerns are and what we think we need to do. I think \\nthat relationship is a very important relationship, maybe the \\nfirst important relationship. So we're already working to \\nestablish that.\\n    Senator Cotton. Thank you.\\n    Finally, you mentioned the Robb-Silberman Commission in \\nyour opening statement. That was a commission of experts tasked \\nto recommend ways to ensure that the intelligence community, \\nquote, ``is sufficiently authorized, organized, equipped, \\ntrained, and resourced,'' end quote. What kind of lessons, if \\nany, would you take away from the report of the Robb-Silberman \\nCommission and how applicable are those today, recognizing that \\nwe're about a decade on?\\n    Senator Coats. Well, not all of those recommendations were \\nimplemented. I think it's worth going back and looking at the \\noriginal intent and then the reports from Robb-Silberman. They \\nmade a number of recommendations which were constructive.\\n    But I just think, after 12 years or so, the agency clearly \\nhas evolved into what it is today, but taking a look back at \\nwhere it was intended in the first place to go--and as I said, \\nthis was a compromise piece of legislation, like most \\nlegislation.\\n    It was interesting, in the articles I was reading they \\ntalked to the former directors and a total of eight people who \\nwere in a position to make an assessment as to what exactly the \\nauthorities of the DNI were, and there were eight different \\nanswers. So I think that alone is a signal that we ought to \\nperhaps go back and look and see if we want to make some \\nadjustments to the law.\\n    Now, that would have to be done in conjunction with the \\nCongress, of course. But at some point, I think maybe sooner \\nrather than later, that would be something we ought to look at.\\n    Senator Cotton. Thank you and congratulations again.\\n    Senator Coats. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Cornyn.\\n    Senator Cornyn. Senator Coats, congratulations. Thank you \\nfor answering the call to duty once more, and particularly to \\nyour wife Marsha, who has always supported you through all your \\npublic service. This is a great continuing contribution and I \\nwould expect nothing less from you. So thank you for that.\\n    I wanted to ask about two subjects, one basically to ask \\nfor your help in your new job once confirmed. I've become \\nconcerned that the Foreign Agent Registration Act, which \\noriginally passed back in 1938, needs to be updated. For \\nexample, we experienced during the time that Congress passed a \\nbill called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act that \\nonce Congress voted unanimously to pass that, the President \\nvetoed it and Congress overrode his veto, that a foreign \\ngovernment spent an untold amount of money to try to lobby the \\nUnited States Congress.\\n    It troubled me because I'm not sure many people knew what \\nthe source of the funds or the source of the lobbying effort \\nwas. It just strikes me as really important, particularly in \\nlight of the Russian activities that are going to be the \\nsubject of investigation here, that we look at the Foreign \\nAgent Registration Act to see if it needs to be updated so the \\nCongress and the public can see where money is coming from by \\nforeign countries perhaps hiring lobbyists on K Street to try \\nto influence domestic legislation.\\n    So I'd like to ask for your help and your office's help to \\nwork on that.\\n    Senator Coats. Well, you have that. I want to do that. I \\nthink more transparency needs to be offered to the public \\nrelative to what this is and what this isn't.\\n    Senator Cornyn. Absolutely, absolutely.\\n    I want to go back to a comment that was made by one of our \\ncolleagues, my friend from Oregon, who's asked you and others \\nto produce the numbers of innocent Americans swept up in \\nintelligence-gathering operations. I just want you to talk, if \\nyou will, briefly about all the various minimization procedures \\nto suppress incidental or inadvertent communications.\\n    First of all, it is illegal to target an American citizen, \\ncorrect?\\n    Senator Coats. That is correct.\\n    Senator Cornyn. Without a search warrant.\\n    Senator Coats. That is correct.\\n    Senator Cornyn. So what we're talking about primarily is \\ntargeting foreign intelligence persons overseas.\\n    Senator Coats. 702 is specifically designed for that \\npurpose.\\n    Senator Cornyn. And by the way, the Director of the FBI as \\nrecently as yesterday in my presence referred to 702 as ``the \\ncrown jewels of the intelligence community.'' Would you agree \\nwith that characterization?\\n    Senator Coats. I would. I would and the intelligence \\ncommunity also sees it that way, the entire community.\\n    Senator Cornyn. So we all saw what happened during the \\ncourse of the debate over the USA Freedom Act, which ultimately \\nI voted for. But I'm concerned that we not let the debate on \\nthe reauthorization of Section 702 get caught up in that same \\nsort of hysteria, where some people were worried that the \\nFederal Government was spying on them when that decidedly was \\nuntrue.\\n    But that's history. But I want to make sure, given the \\nimportance of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence \\nSurveillance Act to our intelligence community, that we make \\nsure that we do everything possible, first, to educate everyone \\nso that they understand what is authorized and what is not \\nauthorized, and then to work with the Congress to come up with \\nan orderly way to make sure that these crown jewels of the \\nintelligence community, this Section 702, is authorized.\\n    I want people to understand that people aren't targeted, \\neven foreign agents overseas, without court approval, and there \\nis judicial review from time to time. There is oversight and \\nreview within the Executive Branch, and heaven knows there's a \\nlot of oversight here in the Congress over this, as well as in \\nthe various intelligence agencies themselves. There are layers \\nof protection to make sure that no American has to worry about \\ntheir own government spying on them. In fact, every conceivable \\neffort is being made to prevent that and to protect the privacy \\nrights of Americans, which we all agree is important.\\n    So I just ask for your continued help. Obviously, you know \\na lot about the topic. But given the particular importance of \\nthe reauthorization of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence \\nSurveillance Act, we need to work together early to try to \\neducate people, to try to better inform everybody involved, so \\nthat they can be reassured that the proper balance between \\nprivacy rights, which we all agree are important, but national \\nsecurity, that exactly the right balance is struck.\\n    Senator Coats. Senator, I couldn't agree with you more. A \\nlot of my colleagues have heard me talk when I was a member of \\nthe committee about finding that balance. I think from one end \\nof the spectrum to the other end of the spectrum we all are on \\nthe same page, that we cherish our private rights in this \\ncountry. They're constitutionally provided to us. We want to do \\neverything we can to make sure those private rights are secure.\\n    But we also know that the Constitution requires us to \\nprovide for the common defense, and we are under attack from a \\nnumber of sources now, that, whether it's through cyber or \\nwhether it's through any of a number of other ways, the United \\nStates is vulnerable to attack. And they want us to provide--to \\ndo everything we can to keep them safe.\\n    So finding that balance so that we don't take away private \\nrights and at the same time use the necessary tools to \\ndetermine what the bad guys are trying to do, that's important, \\nthat we find that balance point so we can accomplish both of \\nthose.\\n    702 is designed to go after foreign bad guys. It's lawful \\ncollection. In that process there are some incidental, let's \\njust call it, incidental names of Americans, potential names of \\nAmericans. Some bad guy might have on his laptop the names of \\n40 Americans. So if he's targeted for something, all of a \\nsudden 40 American names.\\n    Now, we've put a process in place in devising this law that \\nthere's minimization of this. I won't go into all the details \\nof minimization because I can't explain it as well as others \\ncan. But it is a process that understands that we're not \\ntargeting these people, but incidentally they came up because \\nthey were on this guy's email or on his phone list.\\n    The level of oversight here is all three branches of \\ngovernment, and it's significant to try to secure those \\nprivacies. There's a query practice. But all these are \\nauthorized. All these are under court review and oversight \\nreview.\\n    This is such a critical tool, I think it deserves full \\ntransparency to the level that we can while still protecting \\nsources and methods and classified information. We need to \\nensure that the public is not led into a situation where they \\nthink they're, in deference to my colleague from Oregon, \\nsweeping up, collecting information about them.\\n    We're trying to sort it out so that we can find out if that \\nbad guy in Syria or wherever is talking to someone in the \\nUnited States--we kind of want to know what they're talking \\nabout. And there are processes there that protect rights and \\nsort that out.\\n    Senator Cornyn. And there's procedures to go to court if \\nthere is----\\n    Senator Coats. There are procedures to go to court.\\n    Senator Cornyn [continuing]. If content needs to be \\nsecured, and you have to show probable cause and the court has \\nto issue a warrant.\\n    Senator Coats. All of that, all of that.\\n    I worried when I went back home on the issue of bulk \\ncollection and metadata. Now, that's been resolved. 215 of the \\nPatriot Act has been--we don't do that any more. But I was \\nconstantly asked by people back at home: What about this \\nmegadata? And I said: No, it's not ``megadata''; it's \\n``metadata.'' No, no; it's ``megadata''; they're collecting \\neverything on us, they're listening to all our calls.\\n    I asked then--Keith Alexander, who was head of the NSA. He \\nsaid: Well, if we were listening to everybody's calls we would \\nhave to hire 330 million people to work 24 hours a day. That's \\nimpossible; we're not. We're just trying to sort out the bad \\nguys from the good guys.\\n    Now, that's a discussion that we don't have to have. It's \\ndone. It's the law. We're following the law. We have a new \\nsystem now and it would be up to policymakers if they want to \\nmake any adjustments to that.\\n    But the 702 is such a valuable tool regarding what foreign \\nbad people are trying to do to Americans that I think the \\nintelligence community feels very strongly about it. It's your \\ndecision. We need to provide you with the information that you \\nneed in order to make decisions as to how to go forward with \\nthis program.\\n    I'm sorry I got into a sermon mode there and it's a little \\nbit over the top and I used up your time.\\n    Chairman Burr. Your wife was giving you this [indicating].\\n    Senator Coats. That wouldn't be the first time, Richard.\\n    [Laughter.]\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Wyden has asked for one additional \\nquestion. Are there other members who seek additional \\nquestions?\\n    [No response.]\\n    Senator Wyden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    I think we do need to clarify this 702 issue, because it is \\ncritical to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Let's \\nstipulate that I and every member of the Senate wants to go \\nafter the foreign threats or, as you correctly call them, \\n``foreign bad guys.'' No question about it.\\n    What has happened, because communications have gotten so \\nsophisticated and globally integrated, an indeterminate number \\nof innocent Americans have their communications being collected \\nunder Section 702, and the government can then conduct searches \\nfor their communications without a court order or even a \\nparticular suspicion.\\n    Now, to just step back, our two-part question. I asked you \\nif you would get the public the number of how many innocent, \\nlaw-abiding Americans are being swept under FISA 702 \\ncollection. You said yes. And then you went on to say it was \\nhard.\\n    So my two-part question is: Is the answer still yes, you \\nwill get us the number; and since we have been trying to get \\nthis for years and years, literally, as you know from being on \\nthe committee, will you commit now to getting us a report every \\n30 days until we get this number? We need it for \\nreauthorization and it goes right to the heart, frankly, of how \\nyou do the balance you're talking about: foreign bad guys, \\nabsolutely; but an indeterminate number of people are being \\nswept up because global communications are now so \\nsophisticated.\\n    So two-part question: Will you stay with your earlier \\nanswer and say you will get us the number of innocent Americans \\nwho are swept up before reauthorization? That is a yes-or-no. \\nAnd before you answer yes--is the answer still yes? Is it yes \\nor no?\\n    Senator Coats. Senator, I can't answer that with yes or no \\nbecause I qualified my yes with you. At least that was my \\nintent. Let me just explain. I qualified it because I said it \\nhas been extremely hard to come up with that number for various \\nreasons, which I don't fully understand.\\n    I said I wanted to talk to Director Rogers, I wanted to \\ntalk to NSA, in terms of what's the problem here, why can't we, \\nand what is the right definition in terms of swept up and the \\nnumber. So basically, what I hope that I said--and I want to \\nclarify the record for this--is that I will do my best to work \\nto try to find out if we can get that number, but I need first \\nto find out about why we can't get it. I don't think anybody's \\ntrying to withhold it from you.\\n    Senator Wyden. Let's go to my second part. Will you commit \\nnow to getting us a response every 30 days until we get this \\nquestion answered? Because this has gone on literally--I say \\nthis to my friend: this has gone on for years, and it has been \\nsort of one reason after another. And these are law-abiding \\nAmericans. So will you report to us every 30 days until we get \\nthis answered? That's a yes or no.\\n    Senator Coats. Well, I don't see that as a yes or no either \\nuntil I get the answer in terms of whether that's even \\npossible. I can call up Admiral Rogers once every 30 days and \\nsay, where are we. But I would like to first understand why it \\nis, what the issue is here in terms of getting that exact \\nnumber. I don't want to come up with a number that once again \\ntells the American people something that----\\n    Senator Wyden. Nobody's ever come up with a number here. \\nWe've had years of stalling on this. This is a legitimate \\nquestion. You're a friend. I need to know the answer. I need to \\nknow the answers to those questions before we have a vote in \\nhere, because this is central to your key priority, which is \\nreauthorizing 702. You've got me at a low on going after the \\nforeign threats, but I'm not there with respect to these \\nanswers on innocent Americans.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Burr. The Chair would ask unanimous consent to \\nenter into the record a letter to the committee, Senator \\nWarner, and myself from the Electronic Privacy Information \\nCenter. Without objection, so ordered.\\n    [The material referred to follows:]\\n    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n    \\n    Chairman Burr. Dan, one last question. Just to make it \\nclear, the Executive Order, which was National Security \\nPresidential Memorandum No. 2, has not been amended since it \\nwas issued, correct?\\n    Senator Coats. That is absolutely correct.\\n    Chairman Burr. There was a question.
