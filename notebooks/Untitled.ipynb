I will now call the Strategic Subcommittee \\nto order. The subcommittee meets today to hear from the panel \\nto Assess the Reliability, Safety, and Security of the United \\nStates Nuclear Stockpile.\\n    Although the panel's chairman, Dr. John Foster, could not \\nbe here today, we are pleased to hear from two very \\ndistinguished members of the panel, Dr. James R. Schlesinger \\nand Mr. Steven J. Guidice.\\n    The panel was established pursuant to the National Defense \\nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. This committee strongly \\nsupports and commends the work the panel has undertaken and the \\ntwo reports it has issued. The law mandates that the panel \\nsubmit to Congress an annual report for 3 years setting forth \\nits findings and conclusions. This report results from the \\npanel's review and assessment of the Department of Energy's \\nannual nuclear weapons certification process and the ability of \\nthe Secretary of Energy to set forth clear criteria for the \\nperformance of science-based stockpile stewardship.\\n    I would like to commend all members of the panel for their \\ncomprehensive professional work. Many of the problems \\nidentified by the panel's report have troubled this \\nsubcommittee for a number of years.\\n    The Strategic Subcommittee is responsible for authorizing \\ntwo-thirds of the DOE budget, the bulk of which is in programs \\nnow under the National Nuclear Security Administration, or the \\nNNSA. The panel's report highlights the increasingly complex \\nand difficult task of supporting our Nation's deterrent \\ncapability absent the ability to conduct underground nuclear \\ntesting. I am particularly concerned by the large number of \\nmaintenance problems now confronting the many facilities in the \\nnuclear weapons complex and how these problems will affect \\nDOE's abilities to successfully refurbish and maintain our \\npresent stockpile.\\n    Again, I thank the members of the panel for their hard \\nwork. I understand that Dr. Schlesinger will lead off with an \\nopening statement, and I leave it up to you to decide how to \\npresent the panel's findings and recommendations.\\n    Before recognizing our witnesses, I would like to yield a \\nmoment here to Senator Reed for any statement that he may wish \\nto make.\\n\\n                 STATEMENT OF SENATOR JACK REED\\n\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I welcome Dr. \\nSchlesinger and also Mr. Guidice today, and I join with Senator \\nAllard in welcoming you to the Strategic Subcommittee this \\nafternoon to discuss the second in a series of three annual \\nreports from the panel to assess the reliability, safety, and \\nsecurity of the United States stockpile and, as the chairman \\nindicated, this is the first meeting of the Strategic \\nSubcommittee this year.\\n    Maintaining the Nation's nuclear stockpile so that it \\nremains safe, secure, and reliable without underground nuclear \\nweapons testing presents, as the report before us today \\nsuggests, significant technical challenges. The panel was \\ncreated by Congress in the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense \\nAuthorization Act to review and assess the annual process for \\ncertifying stockpile safety and reliability, the long-term \\naccuracy of that process, and the adequacy of the criteria \\nprovided for the Department of Energy for evaluating its \\nscience-based stockpile stewardship program.\\n    In undertaking the mandate to review the annual \\ncertification process, the panel took on the additional task of \\nreviewing whether the Nation can sustain sufficient confidence \\nin the safety and reliability of its nuclear deterrence while \\ncomplying with the terms of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \\nThis more substantive review has broadened the scope of the \\npanel's recommendations. As a result, this year's report \\ncontinues the panel's effort, initiated last year, to assess \\nthe stockpile stewardship program, as well as the annual \\ncertification process. This year's report makes nine \\nrecommendations. We look forward to hearing from our witnesses \\nthis afternoon and assessing these recommendations.\\n    The DOD and the DOE are in the early stages of an effort to \\nreview strategic nuclear systems generally. This review, and \\nthe nuclear posture review that must be completed in December, \\nare important to shape nuclear deterrence policy and strategy \\nand the stockpile to support it. As a result, I hope that this \\nis just the first of several hearings I believe the \\nsubcommittee should hold on the subject of nuclear deterrence, \\nnuclear warheads and strategic delivery systems.\\n    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. OK, I would like to be rather informal in \\nthis hearing if we can possibly get by with it, and just go \\nahead and go right to the testimony from the witnesses, and Dr. \\nSchlesinger, we look forward to hearing your comments.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF HON. JAMES R. SCHLESINGER, MEMBER, PANEL TO ASSESS \\n  THE RELIABILITY, SAFETY, AND SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES \\n                       NUCLEAR STOCKPILE\\n\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Reed, \\nother members of the committee. I am pleased to have you here. \\nLet me just put my statement into the record and make a few \\ngeneral points.\\n    As you have indicated, Mr. Chairman, this panel was \\nestablished in 1999 and authorized to submit three annual \\nreports. This is the second report. Our next report will be \\nfocused upon the readiness for the nuclear testing in Nevada. \\nOur first report focused primarily on conditions in the \\nlaboratories, which I regret to say in some ways has been \\nworsened by the events of recent years. There are signs of \\nimprovement, but we are going to have to move ahead.\\n    This particular report focuses on the infrastructure of the \\nDepartment of Energy. Many of those facilities are 50 years \\nold. When I was chairman of the AEC 30 years ago, and trying to \\nextract maintenance money, it was very hard to come by, and \\nthose facilities are in the process of deteriorating.\\n    Mr. Guidice, who was the head of the weapons program at our \\noperations office in Albuquerque, will discuss these defects \\nand deterioration in detail, and I will just mention a few \\nexamples at the close, but the first point that I would like to \\nmake is that this must be judged in terms of the repeated \\ncommitments of this Nation to sustain a nuclear deterrent that \\nis credible to our potential foes across a whole spectrum of \\nthreats, and that means that they must see our weapons \\nthemselves as well as the weapons carriers to be reliable.\\n    I have thrown in a few statements, statements by the Senate \\nin the past as it reviewed the arms control agreements, \\nstatements by President Clinton when he put forward the \\nproposal for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, that under all \\ncircumstances we would regard the maintenance of our strategic \\nnuclear deterrent as in the supreme national interest.\\n    Our problem as a panel is that, having heard these firm \\ncommitments, there must be the resources to sustain those \\ncommitments, and there we get a little bit worried. I must say, \\nMr. Chairman, that the job of the panel is not to find the \\nresources. That is your difficult task. Our panel is simply to \\npoint out what is happening both to the infrastructure and to \\nthe stockpile stewardship program.\\n    The infrastructure is deteriorating, the stockpile \\nstewardship program is slipping, and so we have a choice as a \\nNation whether we will provide the resources to sustain the \\ndeterrent, as we have repeatedly committed ourselves to do, or \\nmerely pay lip service to that commitment and watch it further \\ndeteriorate.\\n    The problem with regard to the infrastructure, Mr. \\nChairman, is not simply a problem of the size of the stockpile. \\nThere are a whole range of possible levels of the stockpile. \\nBut irrespective of the size of the stockpile, we will need to \\nrevive the infrastructure.\\n    Mr. Guidice will explain this in great detail shortly, but \\nI just cite two things. First, Mr. Chairman, Rocky Flats was \\nshut down 12 years ago. Since that time, the United States has \\nnot been able to produce a primary for a nuclear weapon. We \\nhave a little effort going on at Los Alamos, but we are \\ndependent upon existing primaries, and alone amongst the \\nnuclear powers of this world, we cannot today produce a nuclear \\nweapon.\\n    Second, we have a display over here of conditions at Y-12 \\nat Oak Ridge. What it tells us basically is the deterioration \\nof those facilities. The workers in one of those facilities are \\nobliged to wear hard hats because of the crumbling of the roof \\nabove their heads, and as a consequence the degraded capability \\nof the country to produce secondaries for nuclear weapons. So \\nif we want to be in a position to fix some defect that may be \\ndiscovered in one of the classes of our weapons, we must \\nupgrade the infrastructure.\\n    Mr. Chairman, let me stop there and turn it over to Mr. \\nGuidice, and he, as I said, was responsible for weapons \\nproduction at Albuquerque, and he knows this program in far \\ngreater detail than do I.\\n    [The prepared statement of Dr. Schlesinger follows:]\\n\\n                Prepared Statement by James Schlesinger\\n\\n    Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee. In 1999, Congress \\nestablished the Panel to Assess the Reliability, Safety, and Security \\nof the United States Nuclear Stockpile, chaired by Dr. John Foster. We \\nissued our second report in February, and I offer it to you for the \\nrecord.\\n    I am here today with my fellow Panel member--Mr. Steve Guidice. In \\na few moments, he will provide a detailed review of our Panel's \\nprincipal findings and recommendations. Prior to serving on this Panel, \\nMr. Guidice had a distinguished career of public service, to include \\nbeing director of production and quality for the weapons program.\\n    I shall begin our testimony today. I have a few brief observations \\non some of the major factors that have shaped our work.\\n    The preeminent consideration shaping this Panel's work is our \\ncommitment to meeting the Nation's security requirements. It seems to \\nthis Panel that the centrality of deterrence to the Nation's security \\nand military strategies dictates that we sustain a safe, credible \\nnuclear stockpile. This view is not unique to us. The Nation's most \\nsenior government officials--be they civilians in the executive branch \\nor the Congress, or be they in the military--are on the record \\ndeclaring that a safe and reliable stockpile is a supreme national \\ninterest.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     This commitment was underscored in President Clinton statement \\nwhen he proposed ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty: \\n``The U.S. regards continued high confidence in the safety and \\nreliability of its nuclear weapons stockpile as a matter affecting the \\n`supreme interests of the country. . . .'' William J. Clinton, Letter \\nof Transmittal (Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty), The White \\nHouse, September 22, 1997. This commitment was also central in the \\nSenate's advice and consent to the START II Treaty--``The Senate \\ndeclares that the United States is committed to ensuring the safety, \\nreliability, and performance of its nuclear forces . . .'' Resolution \\nof Ratification, January 26, 1996, (c) Declarations (12).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Mr. Chairman, the nuclear deterrent is a supreme national interest; \\nthe weapons stockpile and its supporting programs should be managed \\naccordingly.\\n    A second consideration that has shaped our work is our belief that \\nsustaining confidence requires a balance of capabilities in our plants \\nand laboratories. In recent years, we lost focus on the weapons complex \\ncapabilities needed for the surveillance, assessments, and maintenance \\nof existing warheads. In the absence of new production, we also did not \\nexercised the integrated design, engineering, and manufacturing \\ncapabilities needed to address the inevitable problems that will arise \\nas the stockpile ages.\\n    Confidence requires that we re-establish, strengthen, and sustain \\nthese core weapons complex capabilities. We already see worrisome signs \\nof deterioration in some nuclear components.\\n    These capabilities are needed whether or not the Nation chooses to \\ncontinue the current unilateral moratorium on underground nuclear \\ntesting. I personally believe the Senate made the correct decision when \\nit decided, by a considerable margin, against supporting the CTBT. I \\nremain concerned that the U.S. could lock itself into a situation where \\nwe cause confidence in our stockpile to erode, while other nations \\ncontinue to develop (and perhaps secretly test) new weapons. I believe \\nthat a different outcome on the treaty might have been possible if the \\nproposed test limitations had a limited duration or allowed a limited \\namount of testing at very low yields--a few kilotons--to allow us to \\nrevalidate the enduring stockpile. Be that as it may, I want to \\nemphasize that we are here today to talk about basic, core capabilities \\nthat will be needed to support nuclear deterrence regardless of future \\ndecisions on testing.\\n    A final consideration involves the size of the stockpile. Although \\nthe Panel was not tasked to develop recommendations on a desirable size \\nfor the stockpile, we would counsel that the debate on this topic must \\naccurately reflect the implications for the weapons complex. Let me say \\nit plainly: Cutting the stockpile will not save much on the size and \\ncost of the weapons complex. So long as we keep more than a handful of \\nweapons, there are threshold levels of capabilities in the plants and \\nlaboratories that will be needed to maintain the stockpile, regardless \\nof its size.\\n    As Steve Guidice will tell you, this Panel is deeply concerned by \\nthe path the weapons program has taken in recent years.\\n    The Nation has grossly under-invested in the weapons complex. So, \\nnow we have 40- and 50-year-old buildings, many of which are on the \\nverge of failure:\\n\\n         In one building at Y-12, workers wear hardhats--not \\n        because their work is dangerous, but to protect themselves from \\n        chunks of concrete falling from the ceiling above them. This, \\n        in an essential nuclear facility. Elsewhere at Y-12, vital \\n        nuclear operations unique to that facility have been shut down \\n        for safety reasons since 1994. Y-12 has been forced to store \\n        nuclear waste products since then. This is an approach that is \\n        fraught with risks and future problems.\\n         Rocky Flats was shut down 12 years ago, and we still \\n        have no capability to produce certified weapon primaries. Last \\n        year we recommended that DOE get started on establishing an \\n        adequate national facility. Not until Congress acted to provide \\n        seed money did DOD begin a low-level of conceptual design work.\\n\\n    It troubles this Panel to report that portions of the weapons \\ncomplex infrastructure are defective and that the production \\ncapabilities that remain are fragile. We see an increasingly urgent \\nneed for a coherent vision, comprehensive plan, and programmatic \\ncommitment to reverse these adverse trends. Where is this vision? If \\naction is not taken soon, I believe a crisis in the weapons program is \\ninevitable.\\n    We strongly support the efforts of this Committee to identify and \\nimplement the program needed to sustain our confidence in a safe and \\nreliable weapons stockpile. Steve will summarize several of the \\nspecific recommendations we commend for your action.\\n\\n    Senator Allard. Before you go on, and without objection, I \\nwill make the executive summary of the report a part of the \\nrecord at this point, and we will go ahead with Mr. Guidice.\\n    [The executive summary of the report is printed here. The \\nfull report is retained in committee files.]\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    Senator Allard. Go ahead.\\n\\n  STATEMENT OF STEPHEN GUIDICE, FORMER ASSISTANT MANAGER FOR \\n          NATIONAL DEFENSE PROGRAMS, DOE, ALBUQUERQUE\\n\\n    Mr. Guidice. I also have written testimony, but what I was \\ngoing to do is step through the report and its recommendations.\\n    Senator Allard. Well, we will make your written testimony a \\npart of the full record of the committee. Without objection, so \\nordered.\\n    Dr. Guidice. I will step very quickly just through the \\nperfunctory of who is on the panel. Dr. Agnew, Dr. Foster, Dr. \\nGold, Secretary Schlesinger and myself, and General Habinger \\nwho has since moved on to the Department of Energy. Our \\nadvisors are the heads of the weapons programs at the three \\nlaboratories, and General Welch from IDA.\\n    This was the actual tasking: Review the annual \\ncertification process, and look at the long-term adequacy of \\nthat process. We have chosen to really focus on the long term \\nadequacy of the process--the stockpile has been certified--and \\nwhat is being done right now to certify the stockpile is \\nadequate. We have no reason to question it. But we are trying \\nto look at the long-term. Right now, stockpile certification is \\nkind of looking backwards at what was the data from yesterday, \\nrather than looking towards what is going to happen in the next \\n5 to 10 years.\\n    We were also asked to look at the criteria. Congress \\nrequested our view on the criteria for stewardship tools, and \\nwe will speak about that in more detail.\\n    It is not all bad news. We are encouraged by the fact that \\nthere is an NNSA, up and starting to run. We do see technical \\nprogress in the stewardship program. We are meeting most \\nproduction demands, but one has to realize how very modest they \\nare in comparison with what we may be faced with doing in the \\nnext 5, 10 years, and we are focused on that, and I will talk \\nmore about that.\\n    We are encouraged. We see STRATCOM developing their portion \\nof the certification process, making it more and more rigorous \\nto make sure that the Government does get an answer, a good \\nanswer each year on whether we need to test or not.\\n    On the less than positive side, there is enough evidence of \\nhigh priority programs being delayed. We do see all the \\nstewardship milestones, the majority of them moving into the \\nfuture for different reasons, some technical, some budgetary. \\nWe still do not see a true connection between the Department of \\nEnergy and the Department of Defense requirements, and we are \\nhopeful that the processes that are about to occur on relooking \\nat the Nuclear Posture Review and what we actually need in the \\nfuture will help that, but there is still not a tight linkage \\nthere.\\n    The stockpile is aging, and we have plenty of evidence in \\nthe record that we do not have the capability at this time to \\nrepair it. The question is, will we be ready in the next 5 to \\n10 years to do that job.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger talked about the condition of the \\nproduction complex. We did go out there, and we did look, as \\nhave many others, and we were alarmed at what we saw, but we \\nwere even more alarmed that there was no process to reverse it, \\nand no plan to reverse it.\\n    There is a problem with morale in the laboratories, with \\nall the safety and security issues that have occurred. It does \\naffect the new generation of stockpile stewards and their \\nwillingness to take on this responsibility, and there is a \\ntendency for DOD to lose focus on this mission.\\n    We did make nine recommendations. Quickly--we do have one \\non the restoration of the production complex. I am going to go \\nthrough each one of these in detail. We do have one on stopping \\nthe slippage on the stockpile life extension programs, we have \\na third on focused on surveillance, which we believe is first \\namong equals in this program. That is our looking glass into \\nthe future, and we believe it needs to have a very high \\npriority in the program.\\n    We have looked at the assessment tools and processes, and \\nwe continue to see those slip as well.\\n    We have looked at the annual certification process, and \\nwhile there is no reason to question the actual certification \\nof the stockpile today, it is worrisome that a lot of \\ninformation about the future is not included in that process, \\nand that is why we have recommended to broaden it.\\n    We have a few recommendations regarding the NNSA management \\nin defining laboratory missions and how the laboratory should \\noperate these days and, of course, there has been for at least \\na decade a number of committees and panels that have reviewed \\nthe Department of Energy management processes. We would like to \\nsee some of the improvements actually be implemented.\\n    We make a recommendation on plans, programs, and budgets. \\nThe 1-year mentality for budget simply will not work for this \\nprogram in the long run. We are hopeful that we will get a \\nmultiyear budget review out of the Department of Energy and the \\nNNSA.\\n    The last two recommendations concern issues we have looked \\nat lightly this year and will look at more heavily next year: \\nthat is DOD's role in being a customer and also the issue of \\ntest readiness, and the way it is structured right now.\\n    In fact, our first meeting this year will be out at the \\nNevada Test Site in early April to go over the readiness \\nposture.\\n    Now I will step in more detail through the recommendations. \\nThese are the nine recommendations.\\n    We saw no plan to reverse the decline. To some degree \\nhistorically it is my personal opinion that the nuclear weapons \\nprogram has always been underfunded as far as capital and \\nmaintenance. But it was more troubling that there was not a \\nplan to rectify it. So we think a 10-year plan is appropriate, \\ngiven the magnitude of what we see out there, which is roughly \\na $700 to $800 million backlog of maintenance, critical \\nmaintenance, and then $300 to $500 million per annum in \\nreplacing some of that infrastructure, which is just frankly \\ntoo old to try to keep patching up.\\n    When buildings reach 40 to 50 years, their decay becomes \\nsomewhat exponential and not linear any more, and therefore in \\nsome cases we are just going to have to bite the bullet and \\nsay, I cannot keep pouring money into this place, I have to \\nbuild a smaller, more modern facility appropriate to the \\nstockpile, and Oak Ridge may be the prime candidate for that \\ntype of philosophy.\\n    Pantex and Kansas City, the other two major production \\nplants, and Savannah River to a lesser extent, are not in that \\nkind of shape.\\n    As Dr. Schlesinger said, we shut down Rocky Flats \\npermanently quite some time ago, and the United States still \\ndoes not have the capability to build a new pit, which is the \\nplutonium component and the first stage of all of our nuclear \\nweapons. What we heard was well, it is not a problem today, and \\nso we will kind of keep kicking the can down the road a ways, \\nand yet we also know that it will take probably 10 to 15 years \\nto build a facility to do this, on whatever scale and whatever \\nlocation you choose.\\n    So our feeling was, you need to get on with the conceptual \\ndesign of what this plant is going to look like and what its \\ncapacity ought to be, sized for the type of stockpile that we \\nplan to keep, and a lot of good work could be done at fairly \\nlow expense prior to final design of that plant before you \\nactually get to the high resource levels of investment.\\n    We added a recommendation on quality processes. That is \\nwhat the six-sigma notation is. Various members of the panel \\nhave had experience in this, and know the benefit of having a \\ntrue quality program in design, development, and production, so \\nwe wanted to lend an endorsement to the NNSA in making that \\npart of their approach to the program.\\n    One of the problems is that the complex is trying to manage \\npeople and facilities without a precise definition of the work \\nthat is going to use those facilities. DOE keeps pushing off \\nthe stockpile life extensions for the weapons, which is the \\ncore work yet it is still trying to maintain facilities and \\npeople, and we believe that that work really helps you figure \\nout what buildings you need to repair and how many people you \\nneed, so we would like that work not to continue to be slipped, \\nbecause what we are losing is the opportunity to train the new \\ngeneration of stewards.\\n    If you look at where the stockpile life extensions programs \\ncurrently are as far as getting into production, they are still \\nseveral years in the distance. We stopped building weapons in \\n1991, and essentially we also stopped designing weapons about \\nthat time. All the new weapons beyond the W88 Trident Warhead \\nwere canceled, so we have now gone virtually a decade without \\ndoing any real work in the integrated design, fabrication, and \\ncertification of nuclear weapons. If we continue to push that \\nout, we will not be able to transfer the skills to the new \\ngeneration of people. They will be untested by the time that \\nthey have to actually perform this work on the stockpile.\\n    Where you are not doing direct stockpile life extension \\nwork on an individual weapon, there needs to be a production \\nreadiness campaign that fills in the gap of the technologies \\nthat will be needed at some time in the future. When the cold \\nwar ended, we did make an attempt at doing that: identifying \\nall of the technologies that would be in our weapons and seeing \\nwhat we needed to actually work on, versus what capabilities we \\nneeded to maintain.\\n    When we looked at it this time, is improving, but we did \\nnot see anybody taking an integrated view that these weapons \\nrepresent some number of technologies. My recollection is that \\nwhen we did it in the early nineties we different categories, \\nand you just cannot let them evaporate, or else you will not be \\nable to repair your weapons when it comes time to do so.\\n    The last bullet on here is kind of controversial, and it \\ngot some attention in last year's report--about designing \\nalternative robust warheads, in view of the National policy of \\nno new weapons. But you have to realize the potential effects \\nof accumulated changes to the very sophisticated weapons we \\nhave right now--some of which have very thin performance \\nmargins because you are trading off safety of the weapon \\nagainst reliability and the use of nuclear materials. So you \\nwant it to be as safe as possible, which means use as little \\nnuclear material as you can, but you also want it to work when \\nrequired, and you are trying to make that balance.\\n    It may turn out that in the future the U.S. would feel more \\ncomfortable and more confident in a simpler design warhead than \\nthe high-performance warheads that we have right now, so we do \\nnot think that you should abandon study of that issue. You may \\nwant to make that trade in the future.\\n    Surveillance we kind of feel is first among equals. We have \\nalways had a robust surveillance program for the nuclear \\nweapons, but it has always been based on the fact that we are \\nturning the weapons over fairly quickly, 8 to 10 years. A new \\ngeneration of weapons.\\n    While we surveilled them we never gave ourselves the \\nopportunity to exactly know where the end of the ``bathtub \\ncurve'' is on the failure probability. Things will go along at \\na certain rate, and then when they age to a certain point, the \\nfailure rate goes up.\\n    We never allowed this--just happenstance, the way the \\nprogram was formed--we never allowed ourselves to find out \\nwhere that was, so surveillance today has to be more forward-\\nlooking to give us advanced warning a greater distance into the \\nfuture about the effectiveness of the stockpile.\\n    Therefore, we used to do random sampling of all the weapons \\nin the stockpile. We still believe in random sampling, but we \\nthink you need to rethink about taking additional samples based \\non day-to-day needs that are peculiar to different weapons \\nbased on their history, so we want a more flexible approach, a \\nmore comprehensive approach. Yu could tailor a surveillance \\nprogram more to a particular weapon's defect history or \\nsusceptibility to aging.\\n    Also, we think there are high-leverage technologies. \\nCurrently, for each weapon type in the weapons stockpile, we \\ngenerally take about 10 or 11 weapons back each year, to \\nPantex, and disassemble them. Right now, of that 10 or 11, only \\none or two weapons get their nuclear components destructively \\ntested. We believe by putting in technologies at Pantex like a \\nvariation on what is commonly called a CT scan that for certain \\ntypes of defectiveness we can look inside of these weapons \\nwithout having to take them apart and increase our data base \\nand our knowledge about the nuclear components in those \\nweapons.\\n    That is not very expensive to do, but it provides you a \\ngreat deal more insight into the character of your stockpile, \\nand so we would like to see those things pushed hard and \\ndeveloped as quickly as possible.\\n    As far as the tools and the processes for future \\ncertification, we see the schedules for all the campaigns \\npertaining to weapons' primary and secondary performance \\nslipping farther into the future. Again, you have the same \\nproblem. You have still a reasonable number of experienced \\npeople who have done this job trying to train people who have \\nnot, and the tools that they will need under a no-testing \\nenvironment are much more sophisticated than we had before. Yet \\nwe keep seeing their completion all moving farther into the \\nfuture.\\n    Congress did ask for a report from DOE on the criteria for \\nthe tools. We believe that DOE did a good first cut at the \\ntechnical part of that. What do these machines have to do? Why \\ndo they have to do it? We believe that this needs to continue \\nto be developed each year as we learn more about the tools that \\nwe need. But the problem with it is we do not see what the \\nmechanism is to make it happen. What I will call the program \\nmanagement aspects of it: how you plan it, budget it, have \\nmultiyear milestones, and how you hit those milestones. So \\nwhile the technical content of what these tools ought to do is \\nfairly well-defined, how you are going to make it happen \\nconcerns us. We hope that comes from an improvement in the \\nbudget and planning processes that Congress has asked for.\\n    As far as the annual certification process, we see the \\nstockpile assessment team (SAT) from STRATCOM become better and \\nbetter. They are very capable people and we respect their \\nopinions.\\n    We are trying to make a point on this slide about the \\nstockpile. The way these weapons were developed, a nuclear \\nlaboratory owned them. It was either a Los Alamos weapon or a \\nLivermore weapon. Well, eventually here we are going to be down \\nto about seven weapon types in the enduring stockpile, and we \\nbelieve all three laboratories need to own those weapons, that \\nall three of them ought to be certifying that they are safe and \\nreliable, and we would like to see the processes developed to \\nenable that. We think that today that the absence of testing \\nrequires that Los Alamos not completely own the W88. In terms \\nof certification we believe, for instance, Livermore ought to \\nhave a say in certifying that weapon.\\n    We were concerned about the reporting process for \\ncertification, unclassified letters. We could not quite \\nunderstand how that could lead to a system whereby you can \\nactually get out on the table what the issue is, and so we \\nrecommended, and Congress agreed, that we should classify the \\ntop level certifications.\\n    We believe that beyond saying that the weapon works today, \\nin many cases what we are really saying is, we do not know of \\nany reason why it does not work, and for a lot of aspects of \\nthis program, you have to be careful to understand that \\ndistinction.\\n    For instance, pit life is one that I would throw in that \\nsame category. When somebody says I think a plutonium pit will \\nlast 60 years, what they are really saying is, I do not really \\nknow of any reason why it will not last 60 years. That is a \\ndifferent answer.\\n    So we want to broaden certification to be more forward-\\nlooking and give an assessment to the Government about where we \\nthink these people and facilities are going to be 5, 10 years \\nin advance. We do not want to water down the technical process \\nthat is going on that says that W88 is fine, but we think the \\nGovernment needs more than that answer.\\n    As far as NNSA is concerned, and the low morale, we believe \\nthat the Baker Hamilton report is sensible. We think people \\nought to follow that, and we did not try to go in any more \\ndepth than that on the particular issue of security.\\n    We still believe it is very important for people to \\nreinforce the mission. We had an opportunity to interview the \\nnew generation of stockpile stewards, the 30, 35-year-olds. It \\nis very important to them that they believe that they are \\nworking on something important, and so the mission and how it \\nis characterized by the Government is very important. The best \\nand brightest always have other opportunities, and they need to \\nbe told why they are doing it especially when they have this \\noverburden of other issues like security being laid on top, in \\na sometimes nonproductive way.\\n    We think that Congress' restoration of the LDRD was the \\nright thing to do. We do believe lab directors need the \\nflexibility to attract talent LDRD as leading edge technology \\nis a good way to do that. We think you did the right thing.\\n    Here again, we are reinforcing roles and responsibilities \\nfor the stockpile. It is a national responsibility. Weapons \\nshould not be owned by one nuclear laboratory or the other.\\n    We think in the end, if stewardship is all about confidence \\nin the people, the technical people who are making the \\njudgments about these weapons, then we have to find ways for \\nthem to have constructive competition. We see in some cases \\nprograms like Dual Revalidation, which we thought was a good \\nprocess for evaluating the condition of a weapon, we see it \\nsometimes abandoned for what we believe the wrong reasons. The \\nwrong reason is, it was too hard to do.\\n    Well, why was it too hard to do? Well, part of the energy \\nlost had to do with things other than technical aspects of the \\nprogram, so we think it is important for the laboratories to \\nfind ways to constructively compete on this certification issue \\nand their responsibility for the weapons.\\n    I will speak personally here. Having done the job of going \\nfrom design to development to production and surveillance, when \\nI look at the stockpile stewardship program today I do not \\nreally see any missing technical elements. There is not a piece \\nof the program missing. What I see missing are the processes \\nfor balancing all of those things. In the initial stages of the \\nstockpile stewardship program we initially had to focus on the \\nissue of no nuclear testing and on the other tools we needed \\nfor above-ground experiments and computing.\\n    I think it is time to go back and look at the other end of \\nthat, and look at the other things that we do in balancing out \\nthe program like the design, development, and production \\naspects of it.\\n    What most people do not realize is that most of the very \\nlarge technical effort was not devoted to nuclear testing. \\nThere is a huge number of skills that are required to deal with \\nthese weapons. The bulk of what the integrated laboratory and \\nconstruction complex did that has been atrophying since the \\nearly nineties. So we are looking at a little bit more balance, \\nnot that the tools are not important. They are, but we are \\nlooking for a little bit more balance in the program.\\n    We are going to spend a little bit more time this year on \\nthis issue of Dual Revalidation versus baselining. The \\nDepartment has proposed baselining. We are not quite sure, it \\nlooks like it has too little rigor, or less rigor than we would \\nlike to see in the program, and so we will look at that in a \\nlittle more depth last year. The roles and responsibilities \\nthing is a decade old. Some day I wish it would go away.\\n    On the multiyear program and budget, we made a \\nrecommendation. We would like to see surveillance treated as a \\nfirst among equals--very high leverage potential there for \\nhelping us through managing through the situation. We want to \\nsee the life extension program put together. But all of this \\nbalancing and moving forward cannot be done with a year-to-year \\nbudget outlook. It needs at least a 5-year look, and hopefully \\nas the NNSA develops, it will provide you all the confidence to \\nrestore some of the flexibility to them to manage this complex \\nprogram.\\n    I will not spend very much time on DOD, except to say we \\nare going to do more of that this year. We really do think \\nthere needs to be a focus on this program and a spokesman for \\nthis program in the Pentagon of helping coordinate these \\nrequirements. You can possibly save yourself a lot of trouble \\nand money by being closely coordinated with DOD, operational \\nfixes may be suitable to problems that develop with the \\nweapons--so that's an added reason for being well coordinated.\\n    We have looked briefly at DTRA, Defense Threat Reduction \\nAgency. Hostile environments or vulnerability requirements are \\nstill in the stockpile. To target sequences for weapons. It is \\nan issue that needs to be paid attention to, and we will look \\ninto that in a little bit more depth this coming year.\\n    Lastly, another fairly controversial issue this year, is \\nthe issue of test readiness. The members of the panel have very \\ndiverse backgrounds, but I think we all agree that when \\nsomebody says it will take 2 to 3 years to run a nuclear test, \\nthat does not make any sense to us. That is not the way things \\nare likely to happen. It will work for certain types of \\nproblems. But that type of posture will not work for problems \\nthat we have already experienced, including one that I had to \\ndo about a decade ago.\\n    So we are going to look at the test posture. What does it \\nreally mean? Are there simple, smart things that you could do \\nto give more flexibility to the Government to act more promptly \\nin case there was a need to test?\\n    As far as next steps for this year, we will again continue \\nworking with the labs and plants. We will review test readiness \\nin DTRA, continue to observe the annual certification process, \\nlook at the tools, see how the programming develops, the 5-year \\nmultiyear budget approach, and monitor progress on the actual \\ninvestment that is going into the facilities.\\n    The last thing which is new in our final year that we would \\nlike to leave for Congress is a set of expectations or \\nindicators on how to judge the health of this program going \\ninto the future. We would like to be able to identify for you \\nwhat parameters you ought to consider in order to judge whether \\nthe program is healthy enough that is, in summary, the report.\\n    I can go back, if you would like to focus on certain \\nissues, if you have any questions.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Guidice follows:]\\n\\n                 Prepared Statement by Stephen Guidice\\n\\n    Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee. I will summarize the \\nprincipal findings and recommendations of our Panel. It has been a \\npleasure, an education and an honor for me to work with my fellow \\npanelists: Secretary Schlesinger, Dr. Foster, Dr. Agnew, and Dr. Gold \\nover the past 2 years. The members unanimously support the findings and \\nrecommendations in our report.\\n\\n                              OBSERVATIONS\\n\\n    The Panel focused over the last year on the National capability to \\nperform the high-priority, day-to-day work of stockpile stewardship--\\nsurveillance, assessments, life extension programs, annual \\ncertification, and production. Our review included visits to the major \\nproduction facilities and the National labs, plus presentations from \\nthe DOE, plant, and laboratory organizations that play a significant \\nrole in stockpile stewardship. The Panel also observed key parts of \\nSTRATCOM's Annual Certification Process.\\n    In this past year, the Panel has observed progress in the \\ndevelopment of the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the Annual \\nCertification Process. While the Panel continues to be impressed by the \\ndedication and technical capabilities of the people doing the day-to-\\nday work, the Panel also sees the new National Nuclear Security \\nAdministration (NNSA) facing some major leadership challenges that \\ncould jeopardize the long-term success of these people and the program. \\nThe leadership challenges are many, and include the need: to develop a \\ntruly integrated program plan and budget; to make difficult judgments \\nabout the proper balance between science and the stockpile; and, to \\nrestore morale in a nuclear weapons complex continually embroiled in \\nsafety and security controversy.\\n    Of particular note this year, the Panel found, as have other \\nreviewers, a seriously neglected production plant infrastructure. As \\nthe weapons age and inevitably need repair, the production facilities \\nwill face a much larger workload than today. While alarmed at the \\nmaintenance backlog and the physical condition of some production \\nfacilities, the Panel was most concerned that there appeared to be no \\noverarching strategy to correct this situation. Likewise, the Panel was \\nalso concerned about the lack of focus and intensity of plans to \\nrestore missing production capabilities that will be needed for repair \\nof enduring stockpile weapons.\\n    It is the Panel's view that major steps are needed to put the \\nweapon program on a path that represents our best effort toward \\nsustaining confidence in the safety and reliability of the stockpile \\nover the coming decades. Congress took important steps last year when \\nit increased weapon program funding and established the NNSA. Our \\nreport recommends additional actions that the NNSA, the Department of \\nEnergy, the Department of Defense, and the Congress should take to \\nbuild on these initial steps.\\n\\n                            RECOMMENDATIONS\\n\\nA. Restore missing production capabilities and refurbish the production \\n        complex\\n    A long-term program is needed to redress critical maintenance \\nbacklogs in weapons facilities. We have recommended a 10-year program. \\nDOE estimates this backlog to be $700-800 million. Additionally, DOE \\nestimates indicate another $300-500 million per year will be needed \\nover the next 10 years to redress shortfalls in production capabilities \\nat both plants and laboratories. We found that the same major issues \\nhave been reported by other reviewers, including the DOD, the GAO, and \\nDOE itself. In recent years, the production complex has been unable to \\ncomplete some scheduled weapons work on time due to deterioration of \\nits facilities, some of which are 40-50 years old. When compared to \\nprivate industry standards based on Replacement Plant Value, the DOE's \\nannual investment has averaged only about one-half the recommended \\nrate. Some specific examples of our concerns about production \\ncapabilities follow:\\n\\n         Almost a decade after the DOE decision to permanently \\n        shutdown the Rocky Flats Plant and begin cleanup, we still have \\n        no capability to fabricate qualified plutonium pits for our \\n        enduring stockpile weapon primaries. In our principal \\n        recommendation last year, the Panel emphasized that this \\n        situation must be addressed--it will take 10 or more years to \\n        get an adequate facility.\\n         Some critical production facilities for our enduring \\n        stockpile weapon secondaries have not been brought back on-line \\n        since they were shutdown at the Oak Ridge, Y-12 Plant in 1994 \\n        for health and safety reasons. Of the three major production \\n        plants, the Y-12 Plant is in the worst overall physical \\n        condition.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n         The Pantex Plant, the Nation's only nuclear weapon \\n        assembly and disassembly facility, is in need of critical \\n        maintenance. Special-design facilities for assembling and \\n        disassembling high explosives with fissile materials are in \\n        need of repair.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n         In the post-Cold War transition to a smaller weapons \\n        complex for a smaller stockpile, some production functions were \\n        transferred to the National laboratories. There are also \\n        infrastructure problems at some laboratory facilities needed to \\n        support production activities, such as the Los Alamos Chemistry \\n        and Metallurgy Research Facility.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    In specific, we are not adequately prepared for production in \\nsupport of planned weapon life extension programs (LEPs). In general, \\nthe missing production capabilities and deteriorated facilities leave \\nus even more concerned about our ability to respond to surprises.\\n    To meet long-term needs for nuclear components, the Panel has \\nemphasized the need to begin the conceptual design of facilities needed \\nfor pit production, secondary production, and development work at the \\nnuclear laboratories. We can significantly advance our readiness with \\nrelatively small expenditures on needed conceptual design work.\\n    Our second, third and fourth recommendations deal with the planning \\nand execution of the core stockpile stewardship functions of weapon \\ndesign, production, surveillance and assessment. It has been about a \\ndecade since the last new weapon was produced and new weapon designs \\nwere canceled. Since then, we have designed and produced no new weapons \\nand relatively few components for our enduring stockpile weapons. \\nBecause the nuclear test issue tends to dominate the stockpile \\nstewardship debate, there is a tendency to forget that nuclear testing \\nwas a relatively small fraction of a very large technical effort \\ncarried out by an integrated laboratory and production complex. The \\nknowledge and skill base needed to support design, development and \\nproduction activities is large and it will be needed to support \\ncontinued maintenance of the reliability, safety and security of an \\naging stockpile. If weapon life extension programs, production \\nreadiness campaigns, and the development of better surveillance and \\nassessment tools are continually slipped, then the opportunity to \\ntransfer the knowledge and skills from experienced people to the future \\nstockpile stewards is undermined.\\n\\nB. Stop the slippage in Life Extension Programs and Production \\n        Readiness Campaigns that exercise the capability to design, \\n        fabricate and certify replacement warheads.\\n    Maintaining a complete end-to-end capability is essential for \\nsustaining confidence in the stockpile, and it is a national priority \\nestablished in the first Nuclear Posture Review. The first step is to \\ncommit to and fund the weapons work that we know will be needed over \\nthe coming decade. This includes life extension work on the W76 Trident \\nwarhead, the W80 cruise missile warhead, and the B61 bomb. Production \\nReadiness Campaigns are needed to fill the gap between those \\ncapabilities exercised in the near-term and those needed in the long-\\nterm for life extension work on other weapons.\\n    Another essential step is to initiate programs for the design of \\nrobust, alternative warheads. These would provide training for new \\ngenerations of stockpile stewards, and provide a hedge. Ten or 20 years \\nfrom now, our confidence in robust designs based on previously tested \\nweapons might exceed that in modified versions of today's weapons, \\nwhich have been so highly optimized for weight, yield, and material \\nusage that some have very thin performance margins.\\n\\nC. Increase and enhance surveillance capabilities to predict and find \\n        defects in the stockpile.\\n    This is our first line of defense in discovering emerging problems \\nin the stockpile. NNSA should aggressively exploit new surveillance \\ntools and methods; relatively small investments in available \\ntechnologies could have large payoffs--for example, non-destructive \\ntechnology for inspection nuclear components in weapons returned to \\nPantex for stockpile surveillance. For certain types of defects, our \\ndata could be increased about 10-fold by development and implementation \\nof a CT Scan-like technology.\\n    In keeping with our emphasis on early detection of defects in the \\nstockpile and practical training of a new generation of stockpile \\nstewards, laboratory designers and engineers should seek out greater \\ninvolvement in surveillance activities.\\n\\nD. Stop the slippage in the development of tools and processes needed \\n        to enable future assessments of stockpile safety and \\n        reliability.\\n    In sum, tools must be developed before experienced personnel leave \\nand before the aging process causes significant deterioration of the \\nstockpile. In response to congressional direction, we assessed the \\nscience-based tools being developed. We believe that DOE has made a \\nreasonable effort to describe the weapon physics and performance areas \\nwhere knowledge is currently incomplete and to describe the types of \\ntools needed to obtain this knowledge. We found that while some \\nspecific criteria defining the tools that are needed have been \\ndeveloped, there is not a defined process or timetable to reach closure \\nor assess progress. DOE met the congressional mandate for a report on \\nthese tools on a one-time basis; we believe that an ongoing process and \\nadditional reporting are needed. A better process for linking \\ninformation needs, criteria for stewardship tools, and programmatic \\nmilestones and budgets is needed. Specific Panel concerns include \\nunresolved issues involving the new Advanced Hydrotest Facility (AHF) \\nand the pace of data archiving.\\n\\nE. Strengthen and Broaden the Annual Certification Process\\n    We recommended in our first annual report that Annual \\nCertification, should also include the adequacy of the people, tools, \\nand methods for addressing future problems; the ability of the weapon \\ncomplex infrastructure to find and fix problems; and nuclear test \\nreadiness. It was not, and is not, the Panel's intention to dilute the \\ntechnical certification process in place today. But more than warheads \\nand bombs need to be ``certified'', if we are to maintain our \\nconfidence in the complex system that assures the reliability, safety \\nand security of our weapons. We have suggested possible approaches to \\nfulfill this need. We are encouraged that STRATCOM's Stockpile \\nAssessment Team is playing a more prominent role in assessment of the \\nbroader stewardship goals, accomplishments and shortcomings.\\n    However, we remain concerned with the need for formally defined \\nprocesses to assure that the broader perspective is provided along with \\nthe specific details about our weapons.\\n    Our sixth, seventh and eighth recommendations focus on leadership \\nand management issues for the new NNSA and the DOD.\\n\\nF. NNSA management must respond to morale issues at the labs, redefine \\n        laboratory missions, and address long-standing management \\n        concerns within DOE\\n    First and foremost, the Panel wants to ensure the continued \\nvitality of the competition of ideas within the system of national \\nlaboratories. Continued confidence in the stockpile requires continued \\nconfidence in its stewards. We must sustain a strong system of \\nlaboratories and effective processes for engaging their talents in a \\nconstructive competition of ideas on stockpile matters. Each of the \\nnuclear laboratories should provide a comprehensive review and \\nassessment of each weapon type, irrespective of its laboratory origin. \\nRigorous inter-laboratory review must be employed for major design and \\ncertification issues. Inter-laboratory reviews also must be employed in \\npreserving databases and adapting them to new computer codes. We do not \\nsupport DOE's current proposal to give each lab exclusive rights to \\nindividually baseline the data for the weapons on which it takes lead \\nresponsibility. In the upcoming year, we will continue to investigate \\nthe potential differences in rigor that may result from a \\n``baselining'' approach versus ``dual revalidation''.\\n    The labs' working environments also must be conducive to retaining \\nworld-class talent. We support the recommendations of Senator Baker and \\nRepresentative Hamilton, which are intended to provide world-class \\nsecurity while minimizing unnecessary burdens.\\n    Management initiatives within NNSA itself are also needed. \\nResponsibility and authority needs to be focused in line managers. NNSA \\nshould manage as a Headquarters and not get involved in the details of \\nprogram execution. NNSA roles and responsibilities should be aligned \\nwith Stockpile Stewardship Program deliverables.\\n\\nG. Implement an NNSA plan, schedule and realistic multi-year budget for \\n        the Stockpile Stewardship Program, agreed to by the Nuclear \\n        Weapons Council\\n    Traditional year-to-year budgeting practices have undermined the \\nstability of the program, and eroded credibility in the program's \\nmanagement. Congress has directed important steps toward an improved \\nsystem, and NNSA is working toward it. The Panel strongly encourages \\nthis work. It is our belief that establishing a realistic program and \\nbudget is essential for the health of the Stockpile Stewardship \\nProgram. An essential first step is for NNSA to develop a Future Years' \\nPlan that aligns program goals, tasks, milestones, and resources, \\nlooking out at least 5 years into the future. This will enable NNSA to \\nclarify programmatic goals and resource priorities, and to validate the \\ntotal budget requirements. Incumbent on this process is the need to \\ninclude a mechanism for balancing the requirements of indirect \\nprogrammatic support functions, such as facility safety and security, \\nwith direct programmatic requirements for assuring the reliability, \\nsafety and security of the stockpile.\\n    Collaboration between NNSA and DOD in the forthcoming Nuclear \\nPosture Review is necessary in developing a realistic program \\nresponsive to high-level strategic requirements.\\n\\nH. Department of Defense needs to become a more informed customer of \\n        the NNSA\\n    DOD must continue to develop its Nuclear Mission Management Plan as \\na genuine plan, with milestones and resources that defines the complete \\nDOD requirement. This must be congruent with the DOE Stockpile \\nStewardship Program plan. The Panel also sees a need for more focused \\nsenior leadership within DOD. To this end, it recommends that the \\nposition of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and \\nBiological and Chemical Defense Programs be filled to provide \\nleadership within DOD and promote DOD/DOE collaboration. The Panel \\nbriefly examined the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's program. The \\ndownward trend in funding for nuclear weapons effects research is of \\nconcern. There is a need for an integrated DOD and DOE nuclear weapons \\neffects modeling, simulation, and simulator program.\\n    Recommendation 1. is discussed in next steps.\\n\\n                               NEXT STEPS\\n\\n    In addition to following up on its previous recommendations, next \\nyear the Panel will focus primarily on two areas. First, the Panel \\nbelieves that NNSA needs to determine the cost and feasibility of \\nreducing nuclear test readiness response time to well below the \\ncongressionally mandated one year. Longer lead times create unnecessary \\ndifficulties for a President considering this option. We will explore \\nthese options. Second, we plan to develop a set of indicators that the \\nCongress can use to judge the health of the weapons program. It is our \\nintention to identify actions and accomplishments that you should \\nexpect to see in the coming years that would indicate the Nation is \\ndoing its best to sustain confidence in the safety and reliability of \\nthe stockpile.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n\\n    Senator Allard. Very good.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Mr. Chairman, let me just emphasize a \\ncouple of points. First, with regard to the DOD/DOE interface, \\nthe DOE budget is very closely controlled by the Office of \\nManagement and Budget, basically on an annual basis. The DOD, \\nby contrast, has a future years defense budget that goes over 6 \\nyears at the present time. We need to mesh these two together \\nas far as the nuclear weapons program is concerned.\\n    Unless we bring them into alignment, we are going to \\ncontinue to have these kinds of budget troubles. Mr. Guidice \\nreferred to the 1-year mentality. That is 1-year mentality with \\nregard to the DOE NNSA budget.\\n    Another point to emphasize is, when these facilities were \\nlaid down 50 years ago, the standards of health and safety were \\nquite different from what they are today, and as a consequence \\nyou have greater and greater difficulties making these \\nfacilities functional, and that is the reason that we need to \\nrecapitalize some of them.\\n    The aging weapon issue, never before have we thought that \\nwe would keep specific weapons in the stockpile more or less in \\nperpetuity. In the past, as Mr. Guidice has indicated, we \\nturned over those weapons every 8 or 10 years, so that we knew \\nwhat we had. Now, without the ability to test, we have these \\naging weapons, and we need to surveil them much more carefully \\nthan we do at the present time.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Thank you, Dr. Schlesinger, and Mr. \\nGuidice, I appreciate your presentation, and for members of the \\ncommittee, I think we will move on and see if there are any \\nquestions from the members. We will limit your comment and \\nquestion time to 7 minutes, and we will call on you in the \\norder of having arrived at the committee. My question is, just \\nto start off with, do you feel that NNSA is sufficiently on \\ntrack to meet the needs of science-based stockpile stewardship \\nin terms of accountability and authority?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, we hope it is moving in that \\ndirection. In the past, it is not just the DOD that lacked \\nfocus about this program. The DOE itself lacked focus. With the \\nestablishment of the NNSA, the organization is moving in this \\ndirection, but as yet the final achievement is distant. So we \\nare hopeful, as we indicate in the report. Whether the NNSA can \\nacquire the personnel remains an open question. General Gordon \\nhas sought to attract the appropriate qualified people. He has \\nnot always been successful. However, it is the right structure, \\nand I think that is where your question goes.\\n    Senator Allard. That is correct. Is the NNSA as it is \\ncurrently operating, do you think it is sufficiently able to \\nact autonomously? This was kind of an issue of debate, how much \\nautonomy you give NNSA.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Do you feel that it is sufficiently able to \\nact autonomously?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, of course, the NNSA is responsive to \\nthe Secretary, and the balance of the DOE shares certain \\nfunctions, legal and comptroller, with both sides of the \\nagency, but yes, with regard to program, it has sufficient \\nindependence that it can operate autonomously if it has the \\nconcurrence or support of the Secretary.\\n    Senator Allard. I think your suggestion of a 5-year budget \\nand getting that laid out is a good one, and I can see the need \\nfor that. We will do what we can to push it on this side. We \\nare one committee, and we will do what we can as we move \\nforward.\\n    Has the DOE undertaken sufficient efforts to develop tools \\nto evaluate the weapons physics knowledge base?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Our review of the criteria that they have \\ndeveloped is, they have done a good first cut at the technical \\nrequirements to do this job. What we are most concerned about \\nis the implementation and acquisition of those tools and also \\nhaving that in the planning and budgeting cycle that you all \\ncould see the results. But we think the technical part of this \\nis fairly well understood, on what tools would be needed.\\n    Senator Allard. Now, in the last Defense Authorization Act \\nfor fiscal year 2000, Congress mandated that DOE was to use \\ncriteria to evaluate and develop milestones, and yet it has no \\nplan to update these criteria. Do you have any suggestions on \\nhow DOE could go about making sure that (a) effective criteria \\nare developed and updated and (b) that there is a link between \\ntechnical and resource needs?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Well, in Appendix A of our report this year, \\nwe do lay out a suggested approach for doing that: strategic \\nplanning, plans and budgets, and integration of stewardship \\ncampaigns. So we have laid that suggestion out to them in the \\nappendix of our report.\\n    Senator Allard. Now, the report states that the NIF, \\nNational Ignition Facility's primary mission should be its \\nstated primary goal, and notwithstanding the many other \\nvaluable activities and information which can be gained from \\nthe NIF project, how can we be sure that stockpile stewardship \\nstays the primary mission goal of NIF?\\n    Mr. Guidice. I do not have a good answer for that.\\n    Senator Allard. Do you feel that at their present rate of \\nefficiencies the weapon labs and production facilities are \\ncapable of both supporting work on new weapons and refurbishing \\nthe current stockpile?\\n    Mr. Guidice. No. We are not anywhere close to any position \\nof doing that at any reasonable level. Recently, which is a \\ngood sign, the Nuclear Weapons Council has approved what is \\ncalled phase 6.3 for three weapons, the W76, W80, and B61, and \\nright now we would be hard-pressed to do those life extension \\nprograms as they are scheduled right now, so the question and \\nthe concern that we have, well, when is the plan to be ready, \\nor does it always keep moving out to the future?\\n    My answer right now would be that the amount of work that \\ngoes through the system right now is not sufficient to give me \\nconfidence that we are transferring skills to new stewards and \\nthat we have plans to plug all the holes that have developed in \\nthe technologies.\\n    Senator Allard. Now, I assume that you are familiar with \\nthe submarine-launched ballistic missile warhead protection \\nprogram, and would you discuss how the principles of that \\nprogram could be applied across the current weapons inventory?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Well, first of all I believe that it is \\nembedded in our recommendation about being able to think about \\nrobust weapons as alternatives to highly sophisticated weapons \\nthat are aging, and you may have a problem with accumulated \\nchanges in certifying those weapons.\\n    As far as I am concerned you could apply that to each \\nsegment of the enduring stockpile, or groupings of enduring \\nstockpile weapons, like ICBM warheads, bombs, cruise missiles, \\nand submarine-launched warheads, so I would think it would be \\nwise to continue that philosophy, and you have done one for \\nsubmarines, why not move on to ICBM's or other aspects of the \\ntriad?\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Reed, you are next.\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. As I \\nlisten to you, Dr. Schlesinger and Mr. Guidice, in my mind I \\nhad this vision of a cash register ringing up more and more \\nbills to ensure the security of our nuclear stockpile.\\n    Just looking at the production complex issue, a backlog of \\nabout $700 to $800 million, your recommendation of about $300 \\nto $500 million a year to recapitalize, over 10 years, that is \\nabout $5 billion, and yet I do not sense that it is going to be \\nincluded in the 2002 budget. If it is not in there, what are \\nthe consequences to the complex?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The complex will continue to age and to \\ndeteriorate, and we will be straining to meet what have been \\nthe evolving health and safety standards for the complex, and \\nsome will fall short, and we will be forced to close those \\nfacilities.\\n    If we are to meet evolving standards, we need to have \\nfacilities that are reasonably up to date, and we need to \\nmaintain those facilities. If we do not maintain those \\nfacilities, we are not going to be in a position to sustain \\nconfidence in the stockpile. It is as simple as that.\\n    Senator Reed. Now, Mr. Secretary, there are several reviews \\nunderway. We will have a nuclear posture review later this \\nyear. We have an informal review going on. My sense, and I \\nwonder if it is yours, is that those reviews will add no \\nfurther information to the present evaluation you have done on \\nthe production facilities. I.e., we know right now we have a \\nhuge bill that is pending, and if we are honest we would \\ninclude that in the budget today. Is that a fair statement?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. That is correct, sir.\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Alternatively, we can give up on some of \\nthe objectives that we have set with regard to the maintenance \\nof our strategic forces, or particular aspects of the \\nstewardship program, such as the last one that was mentioned by \\nMr. Guidice, which is the degree of readiness of the test \\nreadiness program. As he indicated, we may be able to get off a \\ntest in 2 or 3 years.\\n    Senator Thurmond. If you would speak a little louder, I \\nwould appreciate it.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Is that what we wanted? We may be able to \\nget off a test in 2 or 3 years? That is by many people's \\ndefinition not a readiness program.\\n    Senator Reed. So it would have an adverse impact on \\nreadiness, to be polite.\\n    You have also talked about the stockpile surveillance \\nprogram as an important area to stress. You have recommended \\ndoing more in the surveillance program and reinstating a dual \\nrevalidation program, and both of these being a combination \\nthat would become the basis for life extension programs. Now, \\nthat is going to cost money also, separate from the production \\nfacilities.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Some of that is simply a reallocation of \\neffort, particularly within the weapons laboratories, the \\nweapons design laboratories. At the moment, they have the \\ncapability to do a Dual Revalidation, for example, but there is \\na tendency to say, well, that is your weapon, we will not \\ncomment on your weapons if you do not comment on our weapons. \\nSo the capability in that respect is largely there.\\n    Senator Reed. So you do not anticipate, in this particular \\narea, significant additional commitment of resources to carry \\nout your recommendation?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think that it is more a question of \\nchanging the strategy than it is an immense increase in \\nfunding.\\n    Senator Reed. Mr. Guidice.\\n    Mr. Guidice. If I might add on the surveillance issue, one \\nof the reasons we pushed so hard is because when you talk about \\nimproving the program, you are talking about a few tens of \\nmillions of dollars in a year, you are not talking hundreds of \\nmillions, and we think it is very high leverage money. You may \\nfind out though that you do not have to do something that you \\nthought you had to do.\\n    Senator Reed. The NNSA has talked about rebaselining or \\ndual revalidation as more or less a substitute for your \\nproposal. Could you comment upon their view, and the \\ndifferences, perhaps, within the two techniques?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Basically, I am not clear that we have a \\nthorough understanding of the definition of baselining. One \\ndefinition of baselining is that you--and the Department is \\ntrying to manage a real issue, the people aging issue--capture \\nall the data and get it written down before all these people \\nmove on.\\n    But one definition or difference would be that there are no \\nexperiments. There are no challenges, or real challenges to \\nsome of the original data about how we certified these weapons, \\nso think of it as a program that has no experimental component \\nto it. Dual Revalidation for the W76, the first and only one \\nthat they have done, did have that experimental component.\\n    But experiments are hard to do, they are costly to do, but \\nyou do provide some real data for maybe, perhaps, some of the \\nsoft spots that were in the original development program.\\n    So baselining, as we understand it right now, is just \\nbasically trying to get all the archived information down and \\ncaptured in one place, but not much more rigor than that.\\n    Senator Reed. As you go forward with your review of the \\nproblem, will you keep this issue under your scrutiny to \\ndetermine what makes sense?\\n    Dr. Guidice. Yes.\\n    Senator Reed. Throughout the testimony there has been \\ndiscussions of the rivalries between the laboratories and the \\nownership of particular weapons by particular laboratories, and \\nthere has been a recommendation to have a more cooperative \\napproach between the laboratories, but also there is that sense \\nof intellectual competition that might spur research effort, et \\ncetera. How do you balance this intellectual competition and \\nthis cooperative approach, Mr. Secretary.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, I think our New England poet, \\nSenator, Robert Frost, says good fences make good neighbors. I \\nthink it is more, that the problem of good fences make good \\nneighbors is the problem of the laboratories, rather than that \\nthere is rivalry between them. The rivalry takes the form of \\nsaying you stay out of our area and we will stay out of yours. \\nI think that encouraging, directing, and getting the laboratory \\nDirectors fully to understand the benefits to the country of \\nboth laboratories validating weapons would be beneficial to get \\nrid of that good fences make good neighbors attitude.\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you, Dr. Schlesinger. Thank you, Mr. \\nGuidice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Thurmond.\\n    Senator Thurmond. Thank you very much.\\n    I ask that my statement be placed in the record.\\n    Senator Allard. Without objection, it will be done.\\n    [The prepared statement of Senator Thurmond follows:]\\n              Prepared Statement by Senator Strom Thurmond\\n    Thank you Mr. Chairman: Secretary Schlesinger, I join the Chairman \\nin welcoming you to this hearing on the status of our nuclear weapons \\nstockpile. I also want to thank you for appearing today and for your \\nexceptional and dedicated service to our Nation.\\n    One of the more significant accomplishments during the my tenure as \\nthe Chairman of the Armed Services Committee was enactment of the Strom \\nThurmond Defense Authorization Act of 1999. In this legislation we \\ncreated the Panel to Assess the Reliability, Safety, and Security of \\nthe United States Nuclear Stockpile. For the past 2 years, this panel \\nhas painted a no nonsense picture of the state of our strategic arsenal \\nand the facilities which are responsible for maintaining that \\nstockpile. Unfortunately, that picture is not pretty. The observations \\nidentified in your two reports are striking. They highlight just how \\nmuch work needs to be done to guarantee our Nation's nuclear deterrent. \\nI assure you that I plan to do all that I can to implement your \\nrecommendations.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger, you may be aware that I am particularly concerned \\nabout the lack of progress made by the department toward fabricating \\nqualified plutonium pits and toward designing and constructing a full \\nscale pits facility. I especially look forward to hearing your thoughts \\nregarding these matters.\\n    Mr. Chairman, this is a significant hearing which will have long \\nterm implications on the state of our strategic deterrent. I \\ncongratulate you for your focus on this important report and the \\ndistinguished group of patriots who prepared it.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n\\n    Senator Thurmond. I have some questions for Dr. \\nSchlesinger.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger, you have had a distinguished public \\nservice career both as Secretary of Defense and Secretary of \\nEnergy, and have had a long association with our nuclear \\nstockpile. Has your confidence in the reliability and safety of \\nour nuclear stockpile changed in the intervening years and, if \\nso, how and why?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Senator, in the past, when we had nuclear \\ntesting, we had a surer way of establishing confidence and \\nreliability. I do not think that we need worry about declining \\nsafety of the stockpile, but I think that the question of \\nreliability is a matter of concern.\\n    In the more than a decade since we last tested our weapons, \\nconfidence in those weapons has declined. Has it declined so \\nmuch that we need to be worried? We do not know the answer to \\nthat. Probably not. Probably at this time we still have ample \\nconfidence, particularly in view of the fact that the emphasis \\nin the United States defense strategy has shifted back towards \\nconventional weapons and away from nuclear weapons, so that the \\nstrain, as it were, on our nuclear capability has lessened.\\n    Nonetheless, it must be each Member of the Senate, each \\nMember of the Congress and the executive branch that will have \\nto decide, in the face of inevitably declining confidence in \\nthe reliability of the stockpile, when and whether such \\nconfidence has eroded to the point that we are no longer \\ncapable of having a credible deterrent that will deter others.\\n    Senator Thurmond. Dr. Schlesinger, last year you identified \\nthe need to immediately begin conceptual design of a full-scale \\nplutonium pit production facility. Unfortunately, DOE failed to \\nacknowledge your advice. This year, your report again \\nhighlighted this issue, and in fact you expressed an even \\ngreater urgency, stating, 10 more years without the capability \\nto produce adequate numbers of nuclear components is pushing \\nthe limit of acceptable risk.\\n    Considering the significance of this issue, what level of \\nfunding per year do you believe is necessary to meet this \\ncompressed time frame?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Mr. President pro tem, our desire is the \\nsame as last year, except it is reinforced. We must begin \\nconceptual design of a facility to produce primaries. It will \\nprobably take a decade before we have that facility, and if in \\nthe interim one of the categories of nuclear weapons on which \\nwe depend were to be discovered to be deficient in its nuclear \\ncomponents, we would be very hard-pressed to replace them, so \\nas a matter of simple caution we must have the capability to \\nproduce primaries, and we were disappointed that Congress and \\nthe administration last year could not agree on proceeding with \\nthe design of such a facility.\\n    Senator Thurmond. Dr. Schlesinger, your report states, and \\nI quote, ``we believe the need to design, fabricate, and \\nqualify new components will increase.'' In your judgment, does \\nthe Department of Energy have the will and capability in terms \\nof facilities, funding, and people to carry out this \\nanticipated need?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I responded earlier to the chairman's \\nquestion with respect to the NNSA. The NNSA is in the process \\nof development. It was created by act of Congress a year ago. I \\nthink that it is the move in the right direction to establish \\nan entity within the Department that has full responsibility \\nand accountability, but as yet they have not passed the point \\nthat we can be assured that they will be able to deliver. \\nNonetheless, at this stage I think that there is the will, \\ncertainly in the NNSA, and I think on the part of Secretary \\nAbraham, to get on with the job.\\n    The real question, of course, is, will they have sufficient \\nresources, both financial--which is the responsibility of the \\nCongress and the administration--and whether or not they can \\nattract the appropriate personnel, and only time will tell us \\nthe answer to that.\\n    Senator Thurmond. Dr. Schlesinger, recommendation H of your \\nreport proposes that the Department of Defense needs to become \\na more informed customer of the National Nuclear Security \\nAdministration. Since Secretary Rumsfeld is currently doing a \\nreview of DOD activities and strategies, what specific \\nrecommendation do you have for him to fully implement the \\npanel's recommendation?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, I think that that is a complicated \\nquestion, Senator Thurmond, and we would be delighted to give a \\nfull answer on your record. However, in recent years the DOD \\nhas not focused on the question of nuclear weapons. It has been \\nunder severe budget pressure. This was a concern of the \\nprevious administration, and most notably, the Deputy \\nSecretary, John Hamre, in that under pressure, the nuclear \\nweapons position of the United States was suffering from benign \\nneglect, to borrow a phrase of one of your former colleagues, \\nin that there was a lack of concern with respect to the weapons \\ncarriers but after 2020 we have no missile production in the \\nUnited States.\\n    The B-52 bomber, which remains the heart of our bomber \\nforce, is supposed to carry on till the year 2040, at which \\npoint it will be over 70 years since production, and this is an \\nindication, I think, that the Department, under pressure, has \\nnot focused on the carriers, and they have been even more \\nconfident, as it were, about the weapons themselves. But as our \\nnumber of our strategic delivery systems declines, the \\nimportance of the individual weapon being reliable increases in \\norder to maintain a deterrent that is credible.\\n    Senator Thurmond. Thank you. My time is up.\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Dayton.\\n    Senator Dayton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I returned this \\nafternoon from Fort Bragg, where I had the unpleasant \\nresponsibility of attending a memorial service for a serviceman \\nwho was killed in Kuwait just last week from Minnesota, and it \\nunderscored, Mr. Secretary, where you said this is not about \\nproviding lip service, it is about life and death, and it seems \\nto me that the least response and responsibility that we have \\nin the legislative branch and in the executive branch is to \\nmake sure that that ultimate sacrifice of a brave man's life \\nand his family's despair is not in vain.\\n    I may refer to Mr. Secretary, I think we refer to Senators \\nlong after they are no longer discharging the office, and I \\nthink Secretaries of Defense may be warranted to have that \\nhonorific longer than Senators, certainly than most, and I \\nexpress my gratitude to you for your continued service to our \\ncountry in this important capacity.\\n    I was very, very alarmed, Mr. Secretary, about what you \\nsaid about hard hats in these facilities, debris falling upon \\nthem. I was touring just last week a nuclear power plant in \\nMinnesota, and I was struck by the impeccable condition of that \\nfacility from everywhere from the roof all the way through, and \\nit seems to me that this contrast is a very stark indicator of \\nthe failure of our Government to provide for truly the National \\nsecurity from within.\\n    I guess I missed some of the earlier questioning, I am \\nsorry, but what are the one, two, and three recommendations you \\nwould have specifically, and how much would they cost to repair \\nthis kind of neglect?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. What we proposed is something on the order \\nof a $300 million a year--perhaps somewhat more than that--\\nrecapitalization program, and a program over a decade to get \\nrid of the maintenance backlog which we estimate at $800 \\nmillion.\\n    Senator Dayton. Now, these are physical repairs, sir?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. These are physical repairs or physical \\nconstruction.\\n    Senator Dayton. I remember your saying just a while ago \\nthat these weapons are now 10 years or more old. I would not \\nbuy or want to rent a car that was 10 or 12 or more years old. \\nShould I be more or less reassured about a nuclear weapon that \\nour country is depending on that is that age?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Senator, the weapons in the stockpile tend \\nto be 20 years of age, and they were originally estimated that \\nthe shelf life was 15 years, so we are 5 years, as it were, \\nover the original estimate of the shelf life.\\n    I would be deeply concerned. I have used the story of \\ntorpedoes that the Navy carried over from World War I to World \\nWar II without ample tests, and when we sent our torpedo \\nbombers in at the Battle of Midway in 1942, none of those \\ntorpedoes worked, or adequately struck Japanese vessels. We \\nwere lucky at Midway, which was the crucial battle of the \\nPacific War, that we also had the dive bombers, which won the \\nBattle of Midway for us, but the torpedo analogy is not a bad \\none, particularly when it is 20 years that these weapons have \\nbeen in the stockpile.\\n    We have a surveillance program, and we have long had a \\nsurveillance program in which we take the components, and we \\ntest the components, and if the components appear to be \\ndefective, we replace them, but these are the nonnuclear \\ncomponents.\\n    The nuclear components are aging. They are radioactive. \\nParts of the weapon are organic materials which do not do well \\nunder radiation bombardment, so that is why I believe that we \\nmust face the fact that with the aging of the weapons and the \\nabsence of testing, that there is some decline in the \\nconfidence in the reliability of the stockpile. Whether that is \\na sharp decline or is a reasonably level decline is something \\nthat each individual, I guess, would have to judge for himself, \\nand whether that has reached the peril point.\\n    Senator Dayton. It is difficult to find out until you need \\nto know.\\n    Mr. Chairman, one last question, if I may, of either of \\nyou. You also said that we no longer have in this country the \\ncapability to produce a primary nuclear weapon.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The primary that drives the nuclear \\nweapon.\\n    Senator Dayton. Right. Is that as alarming as it sounds?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. It is alarming to me, sir. The chairman \\nmay be more ambivalent than I, but I was alarmed when Rocky \\nFlats was shut down in 1989, and I have grown more alarmed over \\nthe years with the absence of the capability to produce a \\nprimary.\\n    As Mr. Guidice has indicated, we have very sophisticated \\nnuclear weapons which were optimized for weight and for yield, \\nand as a result we have thin performance margins in those \\nnuclear weapons, and for that reason, any deterioration in the \\nnuclear heart of a weapon is a source of considerable concern. \\nWe ought to have the capability of replacing a substantial \\nnumber of primaries, even if we do not have to use that \\ncapability.\\n    Senator Dayton. Mr. Guidice, would you care to comment, \\nsir?\\n    Mr. Guidice. No, that said it well.\\n    Thank you both. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Thank you. Senator Nelson from Nebraska.\\n    Senator Nelson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    As you described the infrastructure deterioration, and you \\npoint out the question about replacement of the primaries in \\ntesting along the way to make sure that the aging of the \\nweapons is not the same as deterioration of the weapons, and \\nraise the budget concerns, are the budget amounts which you \\nmentioned, the $300 million for a multiyear program, does that \\ninclude what would also be involved in testing and replacing \\nmany of the component parts, or are we talking primarily maybe \\nentirely, about the infrastructure, the crumbling facilities?\\n    Mr. Guidice. The $300 to $500 million per annum is facility \\nrebuilding and infrastructure, repairing that type of problem. \\nIt has nothing to do with the surveillance or with those \\nexpenditures for weapon components.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. But those expenditures would be relatively \\nmuch lower than that--as indicated by Mr. Guidice in the tens \\nof millions, rather than the hundreds of millions.\\n    Senator Nelson. As we look at this, and of course the \\nclosure of Rocky Flats, is there also an environmental \\ncomponent that makes it a greater challenge for us to be able \\nto continue to do what we need to do, even in replacing the \\nfacilities?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Yes, sir. I mentioned earlier the safety \\nand health standards have been rising. As you indicate, the \\nenvironmental standards have also risen. For that reason, we \\nhave not been able to take the methods of production that \\nexisted at Rocky Flats and simply transfer them to Los Alamos \\nor wherever we build that alternate facility. We have to \\nupgrade them to meet the now-enhanced environmental standards.\\n    Senator Nelson. Do we have the capacity to do that?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think we have the capacity to do that, \\nyes, sir.\\n    Mr. Guidice. But what you are faced with in some places, \\nand Oak Ridge is a good example, is, are these buildings so old \\nand so deteriorated and so many of the safety features have \\nbeen grafted into these old facilities, is it better to keep \\nreinvesting in that, or patching it up, or do you really just \\nneed to build a small, modern facility to meet the current \\nstandards, and start cleaning that old stuff up.\\n    Senator Nelson. It still boils down to a matter of money, \\nwhen all said and done.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Just to use a metaphor here, Senator \\nNelson, the Atomic Energy Commission budget when Dwight \\nEisenhower was President of the United States was about 4 \\npercent of the Federal budget. It is now down to a fraction of \\n1 percent, which over the years did not matter that much, but \\nnow that we face these very aged and in some cases decrepit and \\nfragile facilities, we have to recognize how much these \\nfacilities did originally cost.\\n    Senator Nelson. Then there is the additional question of \\nthe delivery systems such as the aging B-52's.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Yes, indeed, and how is Offutt Air Force \\nBase, Senator?\\n    Senator Nelson. I was just there recently for a briefing. \\nIt is still in great shape. The deterioration you have spoken \\nabout other places has not carried over to Offutt, I am pleased \\nto say.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, those youngsters who used to say \\nthat the airplanes that they flew were older than they were, \\nthey can now say that those planes are getting as old as their \\ngrandfathers were.\\n    Senator Nelson. Unfortunately I believe you are accurate, \\ntoo. Thank you very much.\\n    Senator Dayton. I was out at Pope Air Force Base today. \\nThey said they had planes so slow they worry about the birds \\nfrom behind, not the front. [Laughter.]\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Akaka from Hawaii.\\n    Senator Akaka. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Are you finished, Senator Nelson?\\n    Senator Nelson. I am finished, thank you.\\n    Senator Allard. Yes, OK. Senator Akaka. Sorry.\\n    Senator Akaka. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a brief \\nstatement that I would like to include in the record.\\n    Senator Allard. Without objection, so ordered.\\n    [The prepared statement of Senator Akaka follows:]\\n\\n             Prepared Statement by Senator Daniel K. Akaka\\n\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to welcome Mr. Schlesinger \\nthis afternoon.\\n    The effectiveness of the Stockpile Stewardship program plays a \\nvital role with respect to our national security. The issue of whether \\nor not the United States can sustain sufficient confidence in the \\nsafety and reliability of its nuclear deterrence capability while \\ncomplying with the terms of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is \\nintegral to the decisions we make with respect to this important \\nprogram.\\n    I have reviewed the recommendations made by the panel and look \\nforward to your testimony this afternoon.\\n\\n    Senator Akaka. Dr. Schlesinger, it is good to see and hear \\nyou again, and to hear your comments about this program. I am \\nparticularly interested in one part of this program, and under \\nthe elements for stewardship, it includes talented, well-\\ntrained people, adequate weapons and so forth, but I am \\ninterested in the people, and stewardship.\\n    The panel supports the National Ignition Facility, due to \\nthe critical insights into stewardship this program could \\noffer. Besides stockpile stewardship, which the panel states \\nshould be the prime stated goal of the National Ignition \\nFacility, this facility will also be used by researchers. This \\nfacility could be used by the next generation of nuclear \\nphysicists to replace those critical positions in the \\nDepartment of Energy's laboratories.\\n    This is my question. Is the panel concerned that such an \\nemphasis on stockpile stewardship and classified research at \\nthe National Ignition Facility could detract from the \\nlaboratories' basic research programs, which could otherwise \\nencourage young scientists?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think that is fundamentally a budget \\nquestion, Senator. I think that there has been an attitude in \\nWashington that Livermore overran its estimate on the National \\nIgnition Facility, and that therefore it should be in some \\nsense forced to eat part of that overrun. Obviously, under \\nthose circumstances it will somewhat constrain the balance of \\nits research program.\\n    Senator Akaka. I ask that question because as we look at \\nthe future, and the future stewardship, we are going to need \\nthe young minds, as we have been talking about age here, and \\nequipment. We are going to need those young scientists in the \\nfuture to come in and continue this stewardship, and that was \\nmy concern.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, it is a very appropriate concern, \\nSenator. In this post cold war period there must be something \\nscientifically exciting to attract personnel to the \\nlaboratories, and the NIF was one of those elements that \\nprovided scientists excitement, and I think that may be the \\nmost important aspect of the NIF, even given its role in \\nstockpile stewardship.\\n    Senator Akaka. Thank you very much.\\n    Senator Allard. Thank you, Senator. I would like to follow \\nthat up just a little bit. Over the last few years, there has \\nbeen a push with the labs to get more involved with economic \\ndevelopment activities, and they set up private business \\npartnerships and other activities which do not seem to support, \\nin my view at least, the stewardship mission. Do these \\nactivities detract, or do you think they enhance the core \\nstewardship mission for the labs?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. That in my judgment at least, Mr. \\nChairman, depends upon the choice of activities. Many of those \\nactivities will add to the spirit of excitement within the \\nlaboratory. On the other hand, a laboratory, because of \\nbudgetary concerns, could be induced to engage in what is \\nuninteresting work, or in the eyes of some, make-work, and in \\nthat respect they would certainly detract from the attraction \\nof the laboratory and the ability of the laboratory to perform \\nits fundamental tasks on stockpile stewardship.\\n    Senator Allard. Our inability to attract new talent and \\nwhat-not into the laboratories, do you think that is a function \\nof solely money, or is it part a function of program, or is it \\na function of not seeing a future there 10, 20, 30 years down \\nthe road?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. It is a function of many things, Mr. \\nChairman. Steve is more familiar with these things, but let me \\nsay that for those who worked in the weapons program there was \\na psychological pay-off when you were able to test the weapons. \\nWhen you are dealing with maintenance of aging weapons, there \\nis just that much less of a psychological pay-off.\\n    There has been the problem in the laboratories of what is \\nseen as excessive pressures on security, such that the time \\ninvolved in dealing with the security aspects of the individual \\nresearcher has risen from 10 percent to 20, 30 percent of his \\ntotal time. Well, for one thing, that reduces the amount of \\ntime available for real research, if the researchers are \\ndevoting their time to fulfilling various security-related \\nactivities.\\n    Senator Allard. Has that phenomenon just happened in the \\nlast 10 years, over last year, or over the last 4 or 5 or 6 \\nyears?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think it is really these last 2 or 3 \\nyears, since the eruption of concern, appropriate concern about \\nwhether or not the People's Republic of China had been able to \\nexploit the openness of the laboratory, and those are concerns \\nthat must be dealt with.\\n    There has also been a reaction--there was the reaction to \\nthe Wen Ho Lee case, which in some respects at least appears to \\nhave been exaggerated, but the fundamental point here, Mr. \\nChairman, in my judgment at least, is that the way to deal with \\nthis problem is to raise the security consciousness of people \\nin the laboratories. That is the central feature. If they are \\nsecurity conscious, they will be able to respond effectively in \\ncertain circumstances, and compared to that, many of the \\nofficial requirements and many of the foci of activities become \\nsecondary.\\n    We spend a lot of time building fences to keep people out, \\nbut if you think about aspiring nuclear countries, including \\nthose that already have the weapon and want to upgrade the \\nweapon, you can figure out those particular things in which \\nsuch countries are interested, and those are the areas that we \\nought to seek to protect and to raise the security \\nconsciousness of those involved in them, rather than simply \\nbuilding fences.\\n    The intrusion behind fences has been very limited over the \\nyears. The intrusion into the laboratories because of a lack of \\nsufficient security consciousness has been much greater, and we \\nought to focus on those elements that would be of particular \\ninterest to proliferators.\\n    Senator Allard. I would like to go back to this dual \\nrevalidation issue. If we have one laboratory that is involved \\nin the design and the testing and the manufacturing of data of \\na particular warhead, just how important is it that we include \\nscientific oversight and input from the other laboratories?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, going back to that earlier question, \\nand Steve, you should get into this, going back to that earlier \\nquestion of how much confidence that we have in the stockpile, \\nthese are aging weapons, and when we were turning over the \\nstockpile every 8 or 10 years, and we had large numbers of \\nweapons in the stockpile, the existing system in which each \\nlaboratory owned its own weapons was sufficient to give one a \\nhigh degree of confidence.\\n    Here, we are looking out over 20, 30 years of essentially \\nthe same weapons in the stockpile with changed components, and \\na much reduced number of weapons types in the stockpile. Under \\nthese circumstances, it seems to me, there is much greater \\nadvantage in having one laboratory looking over the shoulder of \\nthe other laboratory as it contemplates the condition of its \\nweapons.\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Reed--did you have a comment, Mr. \\nGuidice?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Well, technically, in the past, we have only \\nbeen able to look at defects in one or two dimensions of \\nanalysis, but all defects in the nuclear package are in three \\ndimensions, and although we are now trying to look at them in \\nthree dimensions, the answers are not clear. Defects cause \\nasymmetries in the implosion and the functioning of the weapon, \\nand it is terribly important that independent eyes look at the \\ndata and try to make a good technical judgment about what the \\nconsequences of the defect would be. I think it is vitally \\nimportant.\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Reed.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Are we at the three dimensions yet?\\n    Dr. Guidice. We are starting, we are in the first part of \\nthe use of three dimensional analysis capability.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. To this point, those computer models have \\nbasically been two-dimensional, and we are getting to the \\npoint, just beginning to get to the point where we can look at \\nthese weapons in three dimensions. That, incidentally, I think \\nreinforces the argument for dual revalidation, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Good point. Senator Reed.\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Secretary, DOE has been trying to develop a multiyear \\nbudget for about 13 years, and the requirement in the fiscal \\nyear 2000 National Defense Authorization Act is, I believe, at \\nleast a fourth statutory effort to obtain a multiyear budget, \\nbut, as you point out, the culprit is the Office of Management \\nand Budget. How do we fix that? How do we deal with that \\nobstacle?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, I am not sure that as an old DOD-OMB \\nman that I would like to describe the OMB as the culprit.\\n    Senator Reed. Who better than you, Mr. Secretary.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think that it is my judgment that the \\nCongress can, and I would suggest should, mandate that the \\nDepartment of Defense budgeting and the DOE budgeting be \\nbrought into alignment, and that, as long as the Department of \\nDefense is operating on a future years defense program of 6 \\nyears, that we should also be looking to the defense programs \\nof the DOE to be looking out that way, and that it is a strong \\nexpression of concern that the OMB collaborate in achieving \\nthat objective. I think that a strong expression of concern on \\nthe part of the Congress would bring about a much broader and \\nlonger-term attitude on the part of the OMB.\\n    Senator Reed. In that sense, Mr. Secretary, would a much \\nmore forceful embrace of the DOE by DOD be helpful in that \\nsense. One perception I have is that with the demise of the \\nSoviet Union, the centrality of nuclear weapons has changed \\ndramatically, and it has created both a mind set and a \\nprioritization which has diminished significantly nuclear \\ndeterrence.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Rightly so. The strategy of the United \\nStates is no longer to initiate the use of nuclear weapons in \\nthe event of successful Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe, \\nand therefore, since initiation is not our concern, and since \\nwe also, in dealing with other nations, including Saddam \\nHussein, have stressed conventional capabilities as our \\neffective deterrent, the emphasis on nuclear weaponry should \\nhave declined, but it may have declined too far.\\n    The DOD is under heavy budgetary pressure itself, and as a \\nconsequence it has lost the focus on nuclear weaponry, at least \\ntemporarily. Secretary Hamre tried to restore this in the \\nrecent administration, and he continues to be concerned about \\nthat. I think that we will see how interested in rebalancing \\nthat perception, that perspective on the part of the new \\nadministration will ultimately be.\\n    Senator Reed. In the light of all these pressures on the \\nrelationship of DOD to DOE, would a significant reduction in \\nthe nuclear weapons stockpile, both deployed weapons, and \\nweapons in a nondeployed stockpile, improve the situation in \\nterms of safeguarding the security of the weapons?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I do not think that the security of the \\nweapons is that----\\n    Senator Reed. The reliability.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The reliability, no, because the weapons \\nwould still continue to age. We only have, what, seven weapons \\ntypes remaining in the inventory, and those weapons are 20 \\nyears old. They continue to age 1 year every year. We are doing \\nsurveillance. We are replacing components, but the reliability \\nwill decline, and it is not a question of the number of \\nweapons, I believe.\\n    As the number of weapons goes down, the great concern is \\nthat the reliability must be maintained, or possibly enhanced, \\nsimply because the deterrent, which we use, at least \\nrhetorically, to deter not only nuclear attacks but chemical \\nand biological attacks against ourselves and some of our \\nallies--we must have a high degree of confidence in that \\nstockpile, and that degree of necessary confidence per unit \\nincreases as the number of units diminishes.\\n    Senator Reed. If I may I have one final question. You have \\ntalked about, and the panel has recommended, the design of \\nrobust alternative warheads, of which the design, and perhaps \\neven the fabrication, would be permissible under the \\nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but to what extent would you \\ndesign, even fabricate a system, and not want to, or have the \\nneed to, test it?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think that there will be those who would \\nwant to test, and certainly people in the laboratory engaged in \\ndesigning these weapons would very much like to test, but that \\nis a matter of national policy.\\n    President Bush, or Candidate Bush said that we would \\ncontinue to observe the moratorium, even though we ourselves \\nwould not ratify the treaty, and as long as that is the rule, I \\nthink that that will certainly be enforced upon personnel in \\nthe laboratories. However, I think that it does two things. \\nFirst, it does provide you with a backup against these \\nsophisticated weapons with relatively thin performance margins, \\nand second it keeps some people engaged in the design process.\\n    Perhaps the greatest problem that we have is the problem of \\nhuman capital. The number of people in the laboratory system \\nwho have ever observed a nuclear test or participated in a \\nnuclear test is declining, and within 10 years they will all be \\ngone. The numbers who have participated in the design of \\nnuclear weapons are rapidly fading out.\\n    One of the advantages of having them design nuclear weapons \\nwithout testing is that it tends to keep that kind of \\nprofessional capability alive.\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, Mr. \\nChairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Dayton.\\n    Senator Dayton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Reed, \\nregarding the reference to the OMB, I have often thought that \\nwhat we need to do is develop a bureaucratic version of the \\nneutron bomb that would leave all the people standing but \\nobliterate the bureaucracy. We could work on that maybe at one \\nof our next advanced facilities.\\n    Senator Reed. A job for Livermore.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. That is an ambitious goal, Senator.\\n    Senator Dayton. An ancillary but still related issue is, \\nand we are struggling with this in the Congress, is the \\ndesignation and development of a permanent nuclear repository. \\nHow does the failure of our country to develop such a site \\nimpact, if it does at all, these aging nuclear weapons, the \\nmaterials, the desire, as you say, or the need to upgrade them \\nand develop new capabilities?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, that is a very complex question that \\nwould require extended discussion, but basically we now have a \\nsite to deal with the waste from the weapons program. It is the \\nsite in New Mexico called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant \\n(WIPP). I think you may be concerned about the arguments over \\nthe site in Nevada, which deals with waste, or the individual \\nnuclear packages from nuclear reactors. That continues to be a \\nmatter of great concern, but we are working effectively, if too \\nslowly, on disposing of the waste from the weapons program \\nitself.\\n    There has been progress in Idaho. I think there is progress \\ncontinuing at Hanford. There is work going ahead at Savannah \\nRiver, so I think that in that area we have less concern than \\nabout how to deal with the byproducts of the nuclear reactor \\nprograms in this country, which has a much stronger ideological \\nelement in it, may I say, than with regard to the weapons \\nprogram.\\n    Senator Dayton. I learned something new. I thought that it \\nwas all going to end up at Yucca Mountain, or some alternative.\\n    Mr. Guidice. Nuclear weapon production does not generate \\nhigh-level waste. They typically generate low-level and some \\ntransuranic, which is a mixture of chemical and low-level, so \\nthe Yucca Mountain is high-level waste from reactors, but the \\nweapons program itself does not generate that kind of waste.\\n    Senator Dayton. Thank you.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. These reactors, the fuel in them runs to \\n30,000 megawatt days. They can be very, very radioactive, \\nwhereas with the weapons program basically you are just dealing \\nwith the byproducts of production, much simpler.\\n    Senator Dayton. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Thank you. I have about four questions \\nhere, and then I think we can call everything to a close. I \\nappreciate your comments this afternoon and the time you have \\ndedicated to the committee.\\n    Both of you indicated that to increase efforts and \\nsurveillance capabilities to predict and find defects in the \\nstockpile as atop priority. I guess the question related to \\nthat, do you believe BOB and NNSA has made surveillance a top \\npriority, and are they responding to your concerns in that \\nregard?\\n    Dr. Guidice. I think they have, at least I am told they \\nhave in the last budget year.\\n    Senator Allard. What about the Congress? I mean, the agency \\nis responding. Do you think the Congress is responding?\\n    Dr. Guidice. I do not know where the negotiation is in \\nthat. I do know that the Department has tried to make an effort \\nto put more money into surveillance on a scale that we thought \\nwas appropriate.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. We will be better able to reach a judgment \\non that, Mr. Chairman, in about 7 or 8 months time.\\n    Senator Allard. I thought you would answer in that way.\\n    With the loss of scientists with actual testing environment \\nexpertise and experience, is there a fear that we could be \\nmoving toward an era in which our stewards are more experienced \\nwith computer codes than nuclear physics, and does that create \\na concern for the reliability, safety, and security of the \\nstockpile?\\n    Dr. Guidice. Absolutely. I mean, that is why it is \\nimportant not to allow these stewardship milestones to keep \\nslipping into the future until everybody else has died off who \\ncould train them, and who has any practical experience to \\ntemper their judgment----\\n    Senator Allard. Experience is the bottom line in a lot of \\nthis, is it not?\\n    Dr. Guidice. Right, and new stewards need some humility to \\nrealize that these things are not as simple as running a \\ncomputer code.\\n    By the way, that is not to demean the current generation of \\nstewards. The ones that I have talked to I think do have a \\nsense of awe about what they are being asked to do, but we need \\nto let them do more while the older, experienced people are \\naround.\\n    Senator Allard. Yes. You mentioned a report in section F, \\nunder NNSA management, on page 24, that unfunded mandates to \\nmeet functional requirements undermine the program budget, \\nplans, and milestones, and I guess the question is, do these \\nmandates come from Congress, or do they come from DOE, or both?\\n    Mr. Guidice. The kinds of unfunded mandates we are talking \\nabout are generally in safety and security, OK. Security is \\nrelatively new, this last round of security. We had a round in \\nthe 1980's as well, but it reaches its height in safety, where \\napproaches to safety are not coordinated with program \\nrequirements, in other words, the work that is actually \\nnecessary to do to maintain the stockpile.\\n    We are hopeful that a true or good planning and budgeting \\nprocess would help decide how much to pay on what are now \\nunfunded mandates, but what we do not see is a process for \\njudging how much is enough. It is very difficult for people and \\nfor organizations to decide how much safety is enough, are you \\nway out on the diminishing returns part of the curve for your \\ninvestment, and what we do not see is the process to put that \\nin balance.\\n    Now, I hope the multiyear budget process----\\n    Senator Allard. It is very difficult to measure.\\n    Mr. Guidice. Yes.\\n    Senator Allard. Could you give me some examples of funded \\nmandates which you believe are not critical to the core mission \\nat NNSA or the labs?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Well, I do not want to give you a specific \\nexample, but I would stick on the issue of safety. A number of \\nthings that we do in safety are way out on the diminishing \\nreturns part of the curve. They go beyond the laws and \\nregulations. They go to interpretation and increasingly \\nrestrictive interpretation. We go through waves of this, and \\ninitially what happens--in fact, there is a wave going on with \\nsecurity right now. The requirements are extremely stringent, \\npeople realize they cannot afford them and pay for them, and \\neventually reason settles in, but only after a long period of \\ntime and a lot of money to get there.\\n    I see that mostly in safety. We do things in the name of \\nsafety that do not really add a lot to safety in terms of \\nvalue-added to the worker and health.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. In cases the redesign of a nuclear weapon \\nhas diminished the reliability of that weapon because of the \\naddition of the safety features that might malfunction.\\n    Senator Allard. I see. Now, in dealing with the question of \\ncooperation between DOD and DOE, to what extent has mitigation \\nof authority and the temporary vacancy of the assistant \\nSecretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological \\nDefense Programs negatively affected the relationship between \\nDOD and DOE, if at all?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, I think the answer to that, Mr. \\nChairman, is that without the critical personnel in the \\nDepartment of Defense in particular, the Nuclear Weapons \\nCouncil, which is supposed to be the bridge between the two \\nagencies, becomes less functional, less attentive to problems, \\nand therefore it is important either to have that assistant \\nSecretary in place, or alternatively to charge somebody else in \\nthe Pentagon with the responsibility to keep the Nuclear \\nWeapons Council functioning.\\n    Senator Allard. Then, just to conclude here, I would just \\nsay--unless, Senator Dayton, you have any more questions, if \\nanyone needs testimony or copies of the slides you can come to \\nthe committee and we will have them ready for you, and we will \\nleave the record open for 2 days for questions, and thank you, \\nDr. Schlesinger and Mr. Guidice.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The pictures over there of the various \\ncrumbling facilities also are available for the record.\\n    Senator Allard. They will be made available. Thank you very \\nmuch.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Thank you, sir.\\n    Mr. Guidice. Thank you.\\n    Senator Allard. The subcommittee is adjourned.\\n    [Questions for the record with answers supplied follow:]\\n\\n                Questions Submitted by Senator Bob Smith\\n\\n    Senator Smith. I note that like the DOE, the DOD has serious \\nproblems sustaining its unique nuclear capabilities. Deterioration in \\nfacilities, loss of experienced senior scientific and engineering \\nstaff, the inability to attract a younger generation, and low morale \\nall apply.\\n    What actions might the Panel take during the third year of study to \\ndevelop recommendations for coordination between DOE and DOD that \\nretain and reconstitute the complementary capabilities of each \\norganization?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. For the first few years following in the Cold War, \\nthe Department of Defense gave, appropriately in my view, less emphasis \\nto the nuclear deterrent. The Panel's concern is that DOD has gone too \\nfar in this regard and that the DOD portion of the nuclear deterrence \\nmission has suffered as a result.\\n    Over the coming year, the Panel will be developing proposed \\nconfidence indicators--measures that Congress might use to appraise the \\nsuccess or failure of stockpile stewardship. This will include measures \\ninvolving the DOD nuclear mission and the Defense Department's \\ncollaborations with NNSA/DOE. For this purpose, we will be looking at \\nthe following:\\n\\n         Do DOD strategy reviews and the revised Nuclear \\n        Posture Review result in a DOD nuclear deterrence mission that \\n        is clearly defined, effectively communicated as a national- and \\n        departmental-priority, and adequately resourced?\\n         Does the DOD Nuclear Mission Management Plan provide a \\n        genuine plan for all aspects of the DOD nuclear mission, to \\n        include specific, measurable objectives; milestones for \\n        accomplishments; and resources? Is the DOD plan congruent with \\n        the NNSA/DOE Stockpile Stewardship Plan? Has DOD defined \\n        specific requirements for the technical capabilities it needs \\n        from NNSA, both to meet currently forecast needs associated \\n        with the enduring stockpile and current delivery systems, and \\n        to meet new requirements if and as the threats to be countered \\n        change in the future?\\n         Is the Nuclear Weapons Council functioning effectively \\n        as the critical interface between DOD and NNSA/DOE? In this \\n        regard, the Panel is encouraged that the NWC has resumed having \\n        regular meetings and that at the end of last year it reached \\n        initial agreement concerning Life Extension Programs (LEP) for \\n        the B61, W80, and W76 weapons. The Panel will be monitoring \\n        actions to define and accomplish these programs, plus the \\n        status of, and lessons learned from, the W87 LEP that has been \\n        underway (and behind schedule) for some time.\\n         Is the Department of Defense providing appropriate \\n        senior-level leadership and oversight for DOD nuclear matters? \\n        In this regard, our second report recommended that DOD return \\n        to the past practice of having an official appointed by the \\n        President and confirmed by the Senate serve as Assistant to the \\n        Secretary for nuclear matters.\\n\\n    As part of our appraisal in this area, the Panel will also be \\nexamining the Defense Department's response to a recommendation posed \\nin 1990 by the Congressionally chartered Nuclear Weapons Safety Panel \\nthat this Assistant to the Secretary of Defense be given a more senior \\nstatus as the OSD member of the Nuclear Weapons Council and upgraded to \\nthe same status as an Assistant Secretary of Defense, with direct line \\nof reporting to the Secretary of Defense.\\\\1\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Nuclear Weapon Safety. Report of the Panel on Nuclear Weapons \\nSafety of the Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives. \\nCommittee Print 15. December, 1990, p. 20.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    The Panel will also give attention to the programs of the Defense \\nThreat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the successor to the Defense Nuclear \\nAgency. In the Panel's initial look at the DTRA program, the downward \\ntrend in funding for nuclear weapons effects research and readiness is \\nof concern. Specific issues to be reviewed include integration of DOD \\nand DOE programs for nuclear weapon effects modeling, simulation, and \\nsimulator technology development; the DOD nuclear weapons effects \\nphenomenology technical base; and readiness for nuclear tests. In the \\ncurrent year, the Panel has already reviewed DTRA test readiness \\nactivities. Our assessment is that DOD does not have a test readiness \\nplan and resourced program.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n                Questions Submitted by Senator Jack Reed\\n\\n    Senator Reed. Dr. Schlesinger, why is funding for the Laboratory \\nDirected Research and Development program important to the overall \\nhealth of the laboratories?\\n    Is this funding equally valuable for the weapons program?\\n    Do you agree with the recommendation of the Secretary of Energy's \\nAdvisory Board Report that LDRD program funding should be increased?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Laboratory Directed Research and Development \\n(LDRD) is a very important component of the programs within the three \\nnuclear weapon laboratories--Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and \\nSandia. It provides laboratory directors with some flexible resources \\nneeded to sustain world-class scientific programs. It enables the \\nlaboratories to initiate development of the next generation of \\ntechnologies in a timely way. LDRD funds are crucial for recruiting the \\nbest and the brightest of the new scientists for whom the labs are \\nalways searching.\\n    Past LDRD funding supported development of some of the key \\ntechnologies being utilized in the Stockpile Stewardship Program.\\\\1\\\\ \\nExamples include radiation hardened microelectronics at Sandia, proton \\nradiography at Los Alamos, and use of laser heated diamond anvil cells \\nto develop new information concerning plutonium equations of state at \\nLawrence Livermore.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ This and the examples below are based on the information \\nprovided in: Review of the Department of Energy's Laboratory Directed \\nResearch and Development Program. Department of Energy, External \\nMembers of the Laboratory Operations Board.

This \\nis particularly important as we implement the science-based stockpile \\nstewardship program.\\n    Particularly at the physics labs (Lawrence Livermore and Los \\nAlamos), LDRD plays an important role in funding postdoctoral \\nresearchers, many of whom are involved in, or transition to, research \\nin direct support of the weapons program.\\n    The specific Secretary of Energy Advisory Report recommendation \\nbeing referenced is:\\n\\n        The Congress should restore the LDRD program at the DOE multi-\\n        program laboratories to at least 6 percent, and should restore \\n        Environmental Management programs to the LDRD base.\\\\2\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Review of the Department of Energy's Laboratory Directed \\nResearch and Development Program.

Dr. Schlesinger, you indicated in your testimony that \\nthe laboratories have been hurt in their ability to attract new \\nscientists and engineers as a result of the increased emphasis on \\nsecurity.\\n    Do you have any specific recommendations on how to improve the \\nimage of labs and their ability to recruit?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. There is a strong commitment to security within \\nthe laboratories, plants, and NNSA. Current issues involve the manner \\nin which responses to recent security incidents have been accomplished. \\nOur Panel endorses the analysis and recommendations of the security \\nreview accomplished by Senator Baker and Representative Hamilton. With \\nregard to the situation within Los Alamos National Laboratory, it was \\ntheir finding that:\\n\\n          . . . the combined effects of the Wen Ho Lee affair, the \\n        recent fire at LANL, and the continuing swirl around the hard-\\n        drive episode have devastated morale and productivity at LANL. \\n        The employees we met expressed fear and deep concern over the \\n        influx of FBI agents and yellow crime-scene tape in their \\n        workspace, the interrogation of their colleagues by the FBI and \\n        by Federal prosecutors before a grand jury, and the resort of \\n        some of their colleagues to taking a second mortgage on their \\n        homes to pay for attorney fees. The inevitable anxiety \\n        resulting from these circumstances collectively has, by all \\n        accounts, had a highly negative effect on the ability of LANL \\n        and the other national laboratories to continue to do their \\n        work, while attracting and maintaining the talented personnel \\n        who are the lifeblood of the cutting-edge work of the \\n        laboratory. This is particularly true in X Division and NEST, \\n        but seems to be a factor in the lab as a whole.\\\\5\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\5\\\\ Science and Security in the Service of the Nation: a review of \\nthe security incident involving classified hard drives at Los Alamos \\nNational Laboratory. A report to the President of the United States and \\nthe Secretary of Energy by the Honorable Howard H. Baker, Jr. and the \\nHonorable Lee H. Hamilton, September 2000, p. 23.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n          The ability of LANL and the other national laboratories to \\n        attract and retain top talent has already been eroded, and now \\n        stands at serious risk. If the National laboratories lose the \\n        ability to attract and retain top talent, then U.S. national \\n        security will be seriously harmed. That harm may be long \\n        lasting, in light of the specialized nature of nuclear weapon \\n        design technology and the inexorable attrition through \\n        retirement and other departures of the dwindling numbers who \\n        understand them thoroughly.\\n          It is doubtful that the DOE, NNSA, LANL, and the University \\n        of California will be able effectively to redress either \\n        security or management lapses in the midst of a continuing \\n        criminal investigation or prosecution.

This will make a significant contribution to the ability \\nof the labs and plants to recruit the top-quality staffs that are \\nneeded.\\n    Our Panel's agenda for the coming year includes development of \\nproposed measures indexing the extent to which we can have warranted \\nconfidence in our stockpile, and the technical and production \\ninfrastructure that supports it. This will include measures dealing \\nwith the weapon labs and plants. These indicators will involve \\nconfidence in the people who do stewardship, in the processes employed, \\nand the adequacy of the criteria for the tools necessary to judge \\nwhether the stockpile can be certified.\\n    Several years ago the Chiles Commission conducted a very insightful \\nsurvey within the weapons complex.\\\\9\\\\ It asked some very important \\nquestions, for example: ``Would you recommend your laboratory, \\nfacility, or test site as a good place to work?''. Responses were 75 \\npercent, yes; 25 percent, no. To allow the changing status of \\nconditions within the labs to be appropriately monitored and appraised, \\nCongress might direct that a follow-on survey asking the same questions \\nbe conducted at several year intervals.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\9\\\\ Commission on Maintaining United States Nuclear Weapons \\nExpertise, Report to Congress and Secretary of Energy, March 1, 1999. \\nQuestion responses are provided on p.

Dr. Schlesinger, you suggested a possible need to \\ndesign a robust warhead design.\\n    Is this suggestion made to ensure maintenance of technical skills \\nto design a new warhead, or is this recommendation made to support \\nactual development, certification and deployment of a new warhead?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Several points warrant attention in addressing the \\ndesign of robust, alternative warheads. A starting point involves \\npolicy considerations as articulated in statements made by the previous \\nadministration that I hope will be endorsed by its successor. The first \\nof these is that having the ability to design and field new weapon \\ntypes is an integral part of the stockpile stewardship program.\\\\10\\\\ \\nSecond, nothing in the proposed CTBT to which the Senate did not give \\nadvice and consent would inhibit the design, development, or production \\nof nuclear weapons.\\\\11\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\10\\\\ ``. . .

Instead, we asked them to design \\nweapons that are safe and are highly optimized for weight, yield, and \\nmaterial usage. The result is that some current stockpile weapon \\ndesigns have thin performance margins. These designs are fussy, and \\npast testing has revealed inconsistencies that are not understood.\\n    Every part within our enduring stockpile weapons is a limited life \\ncomponent; every one of these parts will at some point be replaced.\\\\12\\\\ \\nSome of the original parts will no longer be available; some \\nmanufacturing processes cannot be reproduced.

Chiles, Jr. Before the U.S. Senate Armed \\nServices Committee, October 7, 1999.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    The Panel recommends design of more robust, alternative warheads \\nbased on successfully tested designs for both of the reasons stated in \\nthe question. The objective is to design, develop, and certify robust, \\nalternative warheads that would provide hedges against future \\nuncertainties. We believe that there may come a time 10 or 20 years \\nfrom now at which we may have more confidence in alternative weapons \\nbased on more conservative versions of previously tested designs than \\nwe would have in the inevitably modified versions of enduring stockpile \\nweapons.\\n    In this proposal risk would be reduced by making use of \\nconservative versions of designs that have been previously tested. \\nThere are, however, limits to our confidence in past experience and our \\ncalculations. If a decision is made to introduce a new robust warhead \\ninto the active stockpile, decisions would have to be made concerning \\npotential testing requirements.\\n    The Panel also recommends doing this in order to ensure maintenance \\nof the technical skills needed for design of new warheads. Perhaps the \\ngreatest of our challenges is human capital. We need to train a new \\ngeneration of stewards for the nuclear stockpile. This is most \\neffectively done by having them work now on design of real weapons \\nunder the tutelage of experienced designers.\\n    Senator Reed. Dr. Schlesinger, you and Mr. Guidice discussed that \\nthe weapons programs are burdened by unfunded mandates for health and \\nsafety.\\n    Can you provide some specific examples of specific unfunded \\nmandates and can you identify the source of those mandates?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The most problematic unfunded mandates involve \\ndirection to the laboratories and plants that must be implemented \\nimmediately or in a very brief period of time. Such direction involves \\nactions that were not anticipated when program plans were developed and \\napproved and hence can only be implemented by taking resources away \\nfrom other weapons program activities and resources. In other cases \\nthese mandates involve costs that could be anticipated, but DOE has \\nelected not to program the needed resources. Over the past decade, \\nunfunded mandates have typically involved matters having to do with \\nenvironment, safety, and health (ES&H) and security matters.\\n    In every case the organization with primary responsibility for such \\ndirection is the Department of Energy.\\n    In some instances mandates involving ES&H result from \\nrecommendations made by the Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board \\n(DNFSB). For example, there are 29 actions responding to DNFSB \\nrecommendations scheduled for implementation in 2000-2002. However, it \\nremains the responsibility of the Department of Energy to manage \\nimplementation of such actions in a manner that is responsive to both \\nthe DNFSB's recommendations and the National objectives being \\naccomplished in the weapons program.\\n    In a recent review, the National Nuclear Security Administration \\nhas succinctly summarized the impact that unfunded mandates have on \\ncritical stockpile surveillance tasks:\\n\\n        Efficiency of conducting surveillance cycles and the timeliness \\n        of surveillance data have been adversely affected at the plants \\n        by frequent and unexpected changes in security and safety \\n        requirements, facility availability, and safety authorization \\n        basis changes or expirations. Programmatic needs and schedules \\n        should be considered before implementing changes to facilities, \\n        processes, or safety authorization basis requirements. Of \\n        course, critical safety issues are paramount and must be \\n        addressed as quickly as possible.\\\\13\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\13\\\\ Strategic Review of the Surveillance Program: 150-Day Report. \\nNational Nuclear Security Administration, Defense Programs. January 1, \\n2001.\\n\\n    Many of the recent unfunded mandates involve security. Over the \\npast 24 months, DOE has promulgated more than 40 new Orders, Notices, \\nand other directives. Once issued, contractors are audited to these new \\nstandards.\\n    An example of an unfunded mandate involving security is the \\nSecretary of Energy's 9 Point Cyber Security Initiatives and the Six \\nFurther Enhancements. These were required to be implemented on short \\ntimelines, with no immediate funding for this purpose. In the case of \\nLos Alamos National Laboratory, implementation of this new direction \\nentailed a cost of approximately $15M in fiscal year 2001. At Pantex \\nPlant, the estimated cost was $31.5M. Some of the new standards had to \\nbe implemented within 14 days of promulgation. Subsequent to the \\nissuance of this guidance, DOE made provision for additional funding \\nfor these activities; however, when initially implemented, \\nreprogramming of resources within the plants and labs was required.\\n    Another example that had complex-wide impact was DOE direction in \\nJune, 2000 requiring changes in long-standing security practices. For \\nexample, some computer media had to be encrypted and all vaults for \\nstorage of classified materials continuously staffed and when not \\nstaffed, locked and alarmed. The time frame for implementation varied \\nfrom immediately to 30 days.\\n    The age of many facilities within the complex impacts \\nimplementation of a DOE directive to provide for Nationally Recognized \\nTesting Laboratory or Equivalent certification for electrical \\nequipment. The estimated cost for only the high voltage system at \\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory is $34M. Los Alamos National \\nLaboratory's current estimate for related expenses is approximately \\n$50M.\\n    Many additional examples could be provided. Viewed individually, \\nany specific unfunded mandate may not appear significant. To understand \\nthe impact that these unfunded mandates have on the complex's ability \\nto accomplish the Stockpile Stewardship Program, it is necessary that \\nattention be given to their substance, to the circumstances within \\nwhich they are being implemented, and to the processes employed by the \\nDepartment of Energy in managing their promulgation and implementation.\\n    With respect to the substance of the direction provided in these \\nmandates, there are instances in which new direction is warranted. Our \\nunderstanding of safety, security, and ES&H matters continues to \\ndevelop, due in large part to a vigorous research program that improves \\nour understanding of potential issues. It is the objective of our \\nnational counterintelligence activities to improve our understanding of \\nboth potential security threats and appropriate countermeasures. As new \\ntechnologies are deployed as integral parts of the weapons program, new \\nmeasures are needed, e.g., in cyber security. Standards and \\nexpectations for ES&H and other matters have changed significantly in \\nthe many decades since some of the current facilities were constructed. \\nThere are, however, some situations in which required and implemented \\nmandates did not add to safety or security. For such cases, it is \\nimportant to improve the process in a manner that allows all \\nstakeholders to participate in the appraisal of costs and benefits.\\n    There is a legitimate requirement for the Department of Energy, as \\nthe governmental agency responsible for all aspects of the weapons \\nprogram, to provide top-down direction for these matters. Practices \\nneed to be state-of-the-art and consistent throughout the complex. It \\nis also appropriate for DOE to establish milestones for implementation \\nof measures to enhance safety, security, and ES&H. A past problem \\nwithin the complex was that such issues could be identified without \\nprompt action being taken to redress them.\\\\14\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\14\\\\ In one past situation, a number of years transpired before \\naction was taken to respond to a safety-related issues.

Key issues were identified by the Department of Energy in its \\n30-Day Review:\\n\\n        Additional pressures such as increased security requirements, \\n        newly discovered stockpile issues, and resource limitations \\n        have collectively forced the program, overall, to be ``wound \\n        too tight'' with too little program flexibility or \\n        contingencies. This is evident from the fact that the Campaign \\n        and Directed Stockpile Work is so tightly intertwined that \\n        adjustments to specific program milestones or budgets may \\n        result in significant regrets for the SSP as a whole. . .\\\\15\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\15\\\\ Stockpile Stewardship Program: 30-Day Review. U.S. Department \\nof Energy. November 23, 1999. p. 7-6.\\n\\n    Viewed in isolation, many of the unfunded mandate issues that might \\nbe identified by the laboratories and plants do not appear impressive. \\nWhy should it matter if 10 staff members were diverted to a new task \\nfor a number of months? The problem is that in a program that is \\n``wound too tight'' the few people capable of performing a technical \\ntask are diverted in a manner that requires important weapons program \\nwork to halt, or be significantly delayed, until they are released. A \\nsimilar point holds for management resources within the complex. A new \\ntask that might be readily managed using standard processes and \\ntimelines may, if immediate implementation is directed, take a number \\nof key managers off-line for a period of time in a manner that has a \\nnegative impact on multiple activities that can no longer receive \\nneeded attention. Furthermore, much of the problem is due to the \\naggregate demands posed by the large number of unfunded mandates as \\nopposed to mandate-specific burdens.\\n    Another important circumstance involves the age and deterioration \\nof key facilities. We are attempting to apply modern standards in \\nfacilities that were designed to meet very different criteria. In many \\ninstances implementation is very difficult. Furthermore, aging and \\nuncorrected deterioration make it more likely that issues requiring \\naction are likely to develop.\\n    The processes by which direction is provided by DOE to the \\nlaboratories and plants exacerbate the problems. A important issue is \\nthat there have been too many personnel and organizations within DOE \\nand NNSA capable of issuing guidance directly to organizations within \\nthe complex, bypassing line management.\\\\16\\\\ When this happens, \\nauthority and responsibility are no longer aligned. Congress has taken \\naction to solve these problems through establishment of NNSA, and by \\nrequiring NNSA to develop an appropriate staffing and organization plan \\nto identify roles and responsibilities of headquarters and field \\norganizations; appropriate modifications, downsizing, eliminations, or \\nconsolidations of organization units; and modifications to headquarters \\nand field organization staffing levels.\\\\17\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\16\\\\ The problem that there are too many people within Defense \\nPrograms and measures that might be taken to simplify DOE management of \\nthe weapons program are addressed in The Organization and Management of \\nthe Nuclear Weapons Program.

Spence National Defense Authorization \\nAct for Fiscal Year 2001, Section 3153.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    In its recent report, our Panel recommended additional actions to \\nimprove NNSA management that would, among other objectives, alleviate \\nsome of the burdens associated with unfunded mandates. Specifically, \\nDOE needs to focus responsibility and authority in its line management; \\nall DOE functional interactions with the weapons complex should flow \\nthrough NNSA; and roles, responsibilities, and line management \\nstructures within NNSA should be aligned with the structure of the NNSA \\nprogram.\\\\18\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\18\\\\ Fiscal Year 2000 Report to Congress, Panel to Assess the \\nReliability, Safety, and Security of the United States Nuclear \\nStockpile, February 1, 2001. pp. 24-25.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    A second set of process issues involves the manner in which \\ndirection is developed and communicated. A significant part of the \\nproblem is that direction with a major impact on accomplishment of the \\nweapons program can arrive at the labs and plants with little or no \\nadvance notice. Modern management practices that make use of integrated \\nprocess team (IPT) and related methods could substantially alleviate \\nthis problem. This would involve a team approach in which participants \\nfrom the labs and plants would work with NNSA to give consideration to \\nnew direction before it is issued. This is not to say that the labs and \\nplants should have a veto; the objective, rather, is to involve all \\nstakeholders in a manner that crafts appropriately focused guidance \\nthat can be implemented in a manner that minimizes negative impacts on \\nother aspects of the weapons programs. In a an extreme situation such \\nadvance consultation may not be possible, e.g., if a serious safety-\\nrelated issue is identified. In most circumstances, however, the Panel \\nbelieves that such advance consultation would be practical and, given \\nexperience with IPTs within the Department of Defense, beneficial.\\n    As part of this increased collaboration, the Panel believes that \\nactions need to be taken to reduce the amount of time that technical \\nstaffs within the complex spend on administrative actions that respond \\nto DOE taskings. The Panel recommends that DOE and NNSA give immediate \\npriority to elimination of two-thirds of these burdens.\\\\19\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\19\\\\ Fiscal year 2000 Report to Congress, Panel to Assess the \\nReliability, Safety, and Security of the United States Nuclear \\nStockpile, February 1, 2001. p. 25.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    The Panel also recommends that NNSA, with significant participation \\nfrom the labs and plants, address some of the strategic issues \\nunderlying specific direction for matters involving security, safety, \\nand ES&H. A basic issue is: What are the standards? There is nothing \\nthat cannot be made safer or more secure. There appear to be situations \\nin which the criteria being imposed exceed or do not clearly correspond \\nto law or regulation. This may, in specific situations, be appropriate. \\nHowever, this needs to be established in a more systematic way. This \\nwould allow resources to be more optimally invested in a balanced \\nmanner, complex-wide. It would also allow potential interactions \\nbetween standards to be identified and managed; measures to enhance \\nsafety may or may not contribute to improved security.Furthermore, \\nthere appear to be situations in which, over time, there is \\nrequirements creep that adds to burdens without improving safety and \\nsecurity.\\n    Resources are needed for implementation of new direction. Here the \\nfundamental problem is a weapons program that is ``wound too tight.'' \\nThe Panel believes that the Department of Energy's appraisal is on the \\nmark:\\n\\n        . . . Flexibility and contingency is needed in both the science \\n        and engineering programs and the production facilities to \\n        address these issues. Indicators of stress include lower morale \\n        in parts of the work force and increased difficulty in \\n        recruitment of top scientists and engineers.\\\\20\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\20\\\\ Stockpile Stewardship Program. 30-Day Review. U.S. Department \\nof Energy. November 23, 1999. p. 7-6.\\n\\n    NNSA/DOE needs to program funding to meet security and ES&H needs. \\nGiven recent experience with such mandates , it should be possible to \\nestimate the magnitude of the investment that may be needed.\\n    Senator Reed. Dr. Schlesinger, you mentioned that a weapon has been \\nredesigned to address a safety issue and as a result the reliability of \\nthe weapon has been reduced.\\n    Can you please provide some additional detail on this including \\nwhich weapon, when was the modification made, why was the modification \\nmade and what was the specific requirement that drove the modification?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The point made during testimony applies to \\nmultiple weapons in the enduring stockpile. The reliability estimates \\nfor each of these weapons is classified; however, NNSA does publish \\nsemi-annual classified reports which you might request.\\n    A starting point for considering potential interactions between \\nweapon safety features and weapon reliability is provided in the report \\nof the Congressionally-chartered Nuclear Weapons Safety panel, which \\nprovides an unclassified overview of the modern approach to enhance the \\nelectrical safety of a nuclear weapon against premature detonation. All \\nof the weapons in the enduring stockpile, except the older W62 which we \\nexpect to be retired, were designed to incorporate what is called \\n``enhanced nuclear detonation safety'' (ENDS). The ENDS concept was \\ndeveloped to improve the predictable safe response of our weapons in \\naccident environments, such as a fire. ENDS introduces three links (two \\nstrong and one weak) in an exclusion region within the weapon. For the \\nweapon to arm, both strong links have to be closed electrically, one by \\nspecific operator coded information input, the other by environmental \\ninput corresponding to a trajectory or spin motion appropriate to the \\nweapon's flight profile. The weak link is designed to open (or break) \\nand thereby prevent arming if there is a temperature excursion beyond \\nset bounds, as might be caused by a fire during an accident.\\\\21\\\\ Design \\nor redesign of a weapon to incorporate ENDS necessarily adds components \\nto the device. Each component that is added to a weapon is another part \\nthat might fail, impacting reliability.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\21\\\\ Nuclear Weapon Safety. Report of the Panel on Nuclear Weapons \\nSafety of the Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives. \\nCommittee Print 15. December, 1990. p. 13.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    The same point holds for use control or other features that might \\nbe added to a weapon. Particularly if these features are integral to \\nthe performance of the weapon, they involve additional parts that might \\nfail and, more generally, add to the complexity of the device, and \\ncomplexity can be the enemy of reliability. Furthermore, such safety \\nand control features, like every other part of a nuclear weapon, must \\nbe regarded as limited life components that will at some point be \\nreplaced.\\\\22\\\\ Again, this adds a source a complexity with attendant \\nimplications for reliability.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\22\\\\ Statement by Henry G. Chiles, Jr. Before the U.S. Senate Armed \\nServices Committee, October 7, 1999.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    In regard to plans for Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for our \\nenduring stockpile weapons, over the coming year the Panel will again \\nbe looking at how well we accomplish safety and security in the design \\nof our weapons. We need to make sure that the weapon safety and \\nsecurity improvements that are implemented do not unduly reduce our \\nconfidence in the reliability of our weapons. This is especially true \\nif these improvements are designed into the nuclear package of the \\nweapon, which cannot be tested under the current nuclear test \\nmoratorium.\\n    On this subject, an observation made in the Panel's recent report \\nalso merits attention: The Panel is concerned that some current \\nenduring stockpile weapon designs are so highly optimized for weight, \\nyield, and material usage that they provide very thin performance \\nmargins. These designs are fussy, and testing has revealed \\ninconsistencies that are not understood.\\\\23\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\23\\\\ Fiscal Year 2000 Report to Congress, Panel to Assess the \\nReliability, Safety, and Security of the United States Nuclear \\nStockpile, February 1, 2001. p. 13.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    For the enduring stockpile weapons with these characteristics, the \\ncomplexity (and hence potential performance risk) added by safety and \\nuse control devices is done on top of very thin performance margins. \\nThe enduring stockpile weapons were never designed on the assumption \\nthat they would be retained beyond their originally intended service \\nlives. Under these circumstances, the Panel recommends that, as a \\nmatter of prudence, work also be undertaken on the design of robust, \\nalternative weapons that will provide a hedge.\\n    Looking to potential safety/reliability interactions in the future, \\na final point warrants note. The Congressionally chartered Nuclear \\nSafety Panel was established in response to issues that had been \\nidentified in the stockpile of that time. Some of these issues were \\ndeveloped because of advances in modeling. With the advent of the first \\nthree-dimensional codes, it was possible to determine that some \\nprevious assumptions made concerning the weapons were incorrect. As the \\nStockpile Stewardship Program advances our understanding of the \\nenduring stockpile weapons, it is reasonable to expect that we may \\nuncover additional issues. In 1990, it was still possible to make \\nsignificant changes to weapon designs and then test them to ensure that \\nmodifications did not impair reliability. For a modification that \\nimpacts the nuclear package of the weapon, that option is no longer \\navailable.\\n\\n    [Whereupon, at 4:20 p.m., the subcommittee adjourned.]\\n\\n                                 \\n\\n\\n\""

I will now call the Strategic Subcommittee \\nto order. The subcommittee meets today to hear from the panel \\nto Assess the Reliability, Safety, and Security of the United \\nStates Nuclear Stockpile.\\n    Although the panel's chairman, Dr. John Foster, could not \\nbe here today, we are pleased to hear from two very \\ndistinguished members of the panel, Dr. James R. Schlesinger \\nand Mr. Steven J. Guidice.\\n    The panel was established pursuant to the National Defense \\nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. This committee strongly \\nsupports and commends the work the panel has undertaken and the \\ntwo reports it has issued. The law mandates that the panel \\nsubmit to Congress an annual report for 3 years setting forth \\nits findings and conclusions. This report results from the \\npanel's review and assessment of the Department of Energy's \\nannual nuclear weapons certification process and the ability of \\nthe Secretary of Energy to set forth clear criteria for the \\nperformance of science-based stockpile stewardship.\\n    I would like to commend all members of the panel for their \\ncomprehensive professional work. Many of the problems \\nidentified by the panel's report have troubled this \\nsubcommittee for a number of years.\\n    The Strategic Subcommittee is responsible for authorizing \\ntwo-thirds of the DOE budget, the bulk of which is in programs \\nnow under the National Nuclear Security Administration, or the \\nNNSA. The panel's report highlights the increasingly complex \\nand difficult task of supporting our Nation's deterrent \\ncapability absent the ability to conduct underground nuclear \\ntesting. I am particularly concerned by the large number of \\nmaintenance problems now confronting the many facilities in the \\nnuclear weapons complex and how these problems will affect \\nDOE's abilities to successfully refurbish and maintain our \\npresent stockpile.\\n    Again, I thank the members of the panel for their hard \\nwork. I understand that Dr. Schlesinger will lead off with an \\nopening statement, and I leave it up to you to decide how to \\npresent the panel's findings and recommendations.\\n    Before recognizing our witnesses, I would like to yield a \\nmoment here to Senator Reed for any statement that he may wish \\nto make.\\n\\n                 STATEMENT OF SENATOR JACK REED\\n\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I welcome Dr. \\nSchlesinger and also Mr. Guidice today, and I join with Senator \\nAllard in welcoming you to the Strategic Subcommittee this \\nafternoon to discuss the second in a series of three annual \\nreports from the panel to assess the reliability, safety, and \\nsecurity of the United States stockpile and, as the chairman \\nindicated, this is the first meeting of the Strategic \\nSubcommittee this year.\\n    Maintaining the Nation's nuclear stockpile so that it \\nremains safe, secure, and reliable without underground nuclear \\nweapons testing presents, as the report before us today \\nsuggests, significant technical challenges. The panel was \\ncreated by Congress in the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense \\nAuthorization Act to review and assess the annual process for \\ncertifying stockpile safety and reliability, the long-term \\naccuracy of that process, and the adequacy of the criteria \\nprovided for the Department of Energy for evaluating its \\nscience-based stockpile stewardship program.\\n    In undertaking the mandate to review the annual \\ncertification process, the panel took on the additional task of \\nreviewing whether the Nation can sustain sufficient confidence \\nin the safety and reliability of its nuclear deterrence while \\ncomplying with the terms of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \\nThis more substantive review has broadened the scope of the \\npanel's recommendations. As a result, this year's report \\ncontinues the panel's effort, initiated last year, to assess \\nthe stockpile stewardship program, as well as the annual \\ncertification process. This year's report makes nine \\nrecommendations. We look forward to hearing from our witnesses \\nthis afternoon and assessing these recommendations.\\n    The DOD and the DOE are in the early stages of an effort to \\nreview strategic nuclear systems generally. This review, and \\nthe nuclear posture review that must be completed in December, \\nare important to shape nuclear deterrence policy and strategy \\nand the stockpile to support it. As a result, I hope that this \\nis just the first of several hearings I believe the \\nsubcommittee should hold on the subject of nuclear deterrence, \\nnuclear warheads and strategic delivery systems.\\n    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. OK, I would like to be rather informal in \\nthis hearing if we can possibly get by with it, and just go \\nahead and go right to the testimony from the witnesses, and Dr. \\nSchlesinger, we look forward to hearing your comments.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF HON. JAMES R. SCHLESINGER, MEMBER, PANEL TO ASSESS \\n  THE RELIABILITY, SAFETY, AND SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES \\n                       NUCLEAR STOCKPILE\\n\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Reed, \\nother members of the committee. I am pleased to have you here. \\nLet me just put my statement into the record and make a few \\ngeneral points.\\n    As you have indicated, Mr. Chairman, this panel was \\nestablished in 1999 and authorized to submit three annual \\nreports. This is the second report. Our next report will be \\nfocused upon the readiness for the nuclear testing in Nevada. \\nOur first report focused primarily on conditions in the \\nlaboratories, which I regret to say in some ways has been \\nworsened by the events of recent years. There are signs of \\nimprovement, but we are going to have to move ahead.\\n    This particular report focuses on the infrastructure of the \\nDepartment of Energy. Many of those facilities are 50 years \\nold. When I was chairman of the AEC 30 years ago, and trying to \\nextract maintenance money, it was very hard to come by, and \\nthose facilities are in the process of deteriorating.\\n    Mr. Guidice, who was the head of the weapons program at our \\noperations office in Albuquerque, will discuss these defects \\nand deterioration in detail, and I will just mention a few \\nexamples at the close, but the first point that I would like to \\nmake is that this must be judged in terms of the repeated \\ncommitments of this Nation to sustain a nuclear deterrent that \\nis credible to our potential foes across a whole spectrum of \\nthreats, and that means that they must see our weapons \\nthemselves as well as the weapons carriers to be reliable.\\n    I have thrown in a few statements, statements by the Senate \\nin the past as it reviewed the arms control agreements, \\nstatements by President Clinton when he put forward the \\nproposal for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, that under all \\ncircumstances we would regard the maintenance of our strategic \\nnuclear deterrent as in the supreme national interest.\\n    Our problem as a panel is that, having heard these firm \\ncommitments, there must be the resources to sustain those \\ncommitments, and there we get a little bit worried. I must say, \\nMr. Chairman, that the job of the panel is not to find the \\nresources. That is your difficult task. Our panel is simply to \\npoint out what is happening both to the infrastructure and to \\nthe stockpile stewardship program.\\n    The infrastructure is deteriorating, the stockpile \\nstewardship program is slipping, and so we have a choice as a \\nNation whether we will provide the resources to sustain the \\ndeterrent, as we have repeatedly committed ourselves to do, or \\nmerely pay lip service to that commitment and watch it further \\ndeteriorate.\\n    The problem with regard to the infrastructure, Mr. \\nChairman, is not simply a problem of the size of the stockpile. \\nThere are a whole range of possible levels of the stockpile. \\nBut irrespective of the size of the stockpile, we will need to \\nrevive the infrastructure.\\n    Mr. Guidice will explain this in great detail shortly, but \\nI just cite two things. First, Mr. Chairman, Rocky Flats was \\nshut down 12 years ago. Since that time, the United States has \\nnot been able to produce a primary for a nuclear weapon. We \\nhave a little effort going on at Los Alamos, but we are \\ndependent upon existing primaries, and alone amongst the \\nnuclear powers of this world, we cannot today produce a nuclear \\nweapon.\\n    Second, we have a display over here of conditions at Y-12 \\nat Oak Ridge. What it tells us basically is the deterioration \\nof those facilities. The workers in one of those facilities are \\nobliged to wear hard hats because of the crumbling of the roof \\nabove their heads, and as a consequence the degraded capability \\nof the country to produce secondaries for nuclear weapons. So \\nif we want to be in a position to fix some defect that may be \\ndiscovered in one of the classes of our weapons, we must \\nupgrade the infrastructure.\\n    Mr. Chairman, let me stop there and turn it over to Mr. \\nGuidice, and he, as I said, was responsible for weapons \\nproduction at Albuquerque, and he knows this program in far \\ngreater detail than do I.\\n    [The prepared statement of Dr. Schlesinger follows:]\\n\\n                Prepared Statement by James Schlesinger\\n\\n    Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee. In 1999, Congress \\nestablished the Panel to Assess the Reliability, Safety, and Security \\nof the United States Nuclear Stockpile, chaired by Dr. John Foster. We \\nissued our second report in February, and I offer it to you for the \\nrecord.\\n    I am here today with my fellow Panel member--Mr. Steve Guidice. In \\na few moments, he will provide a detailed review of our Panel's \\nprincipal findings and recommendations. Prior to serving on this Panel, \\nMr. Guidice had a distinguished career of public service, to include \\nbeing director of production and quality for the weapons program.\\n    I shall begin our testimony today. I have a few brief observations \\non some of the major factors that have shaped our work.\\n    The preeminent consideration shaping this Panel's work is our \\ncommitment to meeting the Nation's security requirements. It seems to \\nthis Panel that the centrality of deterrence to the Nation's security \\nand military strategies dictates that we sustain a safe, credible \\nnuclear stockpile. This view is not unique to us. The Nation's most \\nsenior government officials--be they civilians in the executive branch \\nor the Congress, or be they in the military--are on the record \\ndeclaring that a safe and reliable stockpile is a supreme national \\ninterest.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     This commitment was underscored in President Clinton statement \\nwhen he proposed ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty: \\n``The U.S. regards continued high confidence in the safety and \\nreliability of its nuclear weapons stockpile as a matter affecting the \\n`supreme interests of the country. . . .'' William J. Clinton, Letter \\nof Transmittal (Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty), The White \\nHouse, September 22, 1997. This commitment was also central in the \\nSenate's advice and consent to the START II Treaty--``The Senate \\ndeclares that the United States is committed to ensuring the safety, \\nreliability, and performance of its nuclear forces . . .'' Resolution \\nof Ratification, January 26, 1996, (c) Declarations (12).\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Mr. Chairman, the nuclear deterrent is a supreme national interest; \\nthe weapons stockpile and its supporting programs should be managed \\naccordingly.\\n    A second consideration that has shaped our work is our belief that \\nsustaining confidence requires a balance of capabilities in our plants \\nand laboratories. In recent years, we lost focus on the weapons complex \\ncapabilities needed for the surveillance, assessments, and maintenance \\nof existing warheads. In the absence of new production, we also did not \\nexercised the integrated design, engineering, and manufacturing \\ncapabilities needed to address the inevitable problems that will arise \\nas the stockpile ages.\\n    Confidence requires that we re-establish, strengthen, and sustain \\nthese core weapons complex capabilities. We already see worrisome signs \\nof deterioration in some nuclear components.\\n    These capabilities are needed whether or not the Nation chooses to \\ncontinue the current unilateral moratorium on underground nuclear \\ntesting. I personally believe the Senate made the correct decision when \\nit decided, by a considerable margin, against supporting the CTBT. I \\nremain concerned that the U.S. could lock itself into a situation where \\nwe cause confidence in our stockpile to erode, while other nations \\ncontinue to develop (and perhaps secretly test) new weapons. I believe \\nthat a different outcome on the treaty might have been possible if the \\nproposed test limitations had a limited duration or allowed a limited \\namount of testing at very low yields--a few kilotons--to allow us to \\nrevalidate the enduring stockpile. Be that as it may, I want to \\nemphasize that we are here today to talk about basic, core capabilities \\nthat will be needed to support nuclear deterrence regardless of future \\ndecisions on testing.\\n    A final consideration involves the size of the stockpile. Although \\nthe Panel was not tasked to develop recommendations on a desirable size \\nfor the stockpile, we would counsel that the debate on this topic must \\naccurately reflect the implications for the weapons complex. Let me say \\nit plainly: Cutting the stockpile will not save much on the size and \\ncost of the weapons complex. So long as we keep more than a handful of \\nweapons, there are threshold levels of capabilities in the plants and \\nlaboratories that will be needed to maintain the stockpile, regardless \\nof its size.\\n    As Steve Guidice will tell you, this Panel is deeply concerned by \\nthe path the weapons program has taken in recent years.\\n    The Nation has grossly under-invested in the weapons complex. So, \\nnow we have 40- and 50-year-old buildings, many of which are on the \\nverge of failure:\\n\\n         In one building at Y-12, workers wear hardhats--not \\n        because their work is dangerous, but to protect themselves from \\n        chunks of concrete falling from the ceiling above them. This, \\n        in an essential nuclear facility. Elsewhere at Y-12, vital \\n        nuclear operations unique to that facility have been shut down \\n        for safety reasons since 1994. Y-12 has been forced to store \\n        nuclear waste products since then. This is an approach that is \\n        fraught with risks and future problems.\\n         Rocky Flats was shut down 12 years ago, and we still \\n        have no capability to produce certified weapon primaries. Last \\n        year we recommended that DOE get started on establishing an \\n        adequate national facility. Not until Congress acted to provide \\n        seed money did DOD begin a low-level of conceptual design work.\\n\\n    It troubles this Panel to report that portions of the weapons \\ncomplex infrastructure are defective and that the production \\ncapabilities that remain are fragile. We see an increasingly urgent \\nneed for a coherent vision, comprehensive plan, and programmatic \\ncommitment to reverse these adverse trends. Where is this vision? If \\naction is not taken soon, I believe a crisis in the weapons program is \\ninevitable.\\n    We strongly support the efforts of this Committee to identify and \\nimplement the program needed to sustain our confidence in a safe and \\nreliable weapons stockpile. Steve will summarize several of the \\nspecific recommendations we commend for your action.\\n\\n    Senator Allard. Before you go on, and without objection, I \\nwill make the executive summary of the report a part of the \\nrecord at this point, and we will go ahead with Mr. Guidice.\\n    [The executive summary of the report is printed here. The \\nfull report is retained in committee files.]\\n\\n\\n\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    Senator Allard. Go ahead.\\n\\n  STATEMENT OF STEPHEN GUIDICE, FORMER ASSISTANT MANAGER FOR \\n          NATIONAL DEFENSE PROGRAMS, DOE, ALBUQUERQUE\\n\\n    Mr. Guidice. I also have written testimony, but what I was \\ngoing to do is step through the report and its recommendations.\\n    Senator Allard. Well, we will make your written testimony a \\npart of the full record of the committee. Without objection, so \\nordered.\\n    Dr. Guidice. I will step very quickly just through the \\nperfunctory of who is on the panel. Dr. Agnew, Dr. Foster, Dr. \\nGold, Secretary Schlesinger and myself, and General Habinger \\nwho has since moved on to the Department of Energy. Our \\nadvisors are the heads of the weapons programs at the three \\nlaboratories, and General Welch from IDA.\\n    This was the actual tasking: Review the annual \\ncertification process, and look at the long-term adequacy of \\nthat process. We have chosen to really focus on the long term \\nadequacy of the process--the stockpile has been certified--and \\nwhat is being done right now to certify the stockpile is \\nadequate. We have no reason to question it. But we are trying \\nto look at the long-term. Right now, stockpile certification is \\nkind of looking backwards at what was the data from yesterday, \\nrather than looking towards what is going to happen in the next \\n5 to 10 years.\\n    We were also asked to look at the criteria. Congress \\nrequested our view on the criteria for stewardship tools, and \\nwe will speak about that in more detail.\\n    It is not all bad news. We are encouraged by the fact that \\nthere is an NNSA, up and starting to run. We do see technical \\nprogress in the stewardship program. We are meeting most \\nproduction demands, but one has to realize how very modest they \\nare in comparison with what we may be faced with doing in the \\nnext 5, 10 years, and we are focused on that, and I will talk \\nmore about that.\\n    We are encouraged. We see STRATCOM developing their portion \\nof the certification process, making it more and more rigorous \\nto make sure that the Government does get an answer, a good \\nanswer each year on whether we need to test or not.\\n    On the less than positive side, there is enough evidence of \\nhigh priority programs being delayed. We do see all the \\nstewardship milestones, the majority of them moving into the \\nfuture for different reasons, some technical, some budgetary. \\nWe still do not see a true connection between the Department of \\nEnergy and the Department of Defense requirements, and we are \\nhopeful that the processes that are about to occur on relooking \\nat the Nuclear Posture Review and what we actually need in the \\nfuture will help that, but there is still not a tight linkage \\nthere.\\n    The stockpile is aging, and we have plenty of evidence in \\nthe record that we do not have the capability at this time to \\nrepair it. The question is, will we be ready in the next 5 to \\n10 years to do that job.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger talked about the condition of the \\nproduction complex. We did go out there, and we did look, as \\nhave many others, and we were alarmed at what we saw, but we \\nwere even more alarmed that there was no process to reverse it, \\nand no plan to reverse it.\\n    There is a problem with morale in the laboratories, with \\nall the safety and security issues that have occurred. It does \\naffect the new generation of stockpile stewards and their \\nwillingness to take on this responsibility, and there is a \\ntendency for DOD to lose focus on this mission.\\n    We did make nine recommendations. Quickly--we do have one \\non the restoration of the production complex. I am going to go \\nthrough each one of these in detail. We do have one on stopping \\nthe slippage on the stockpile life extension programs, we have \\na third on focused on surveillance, which we believe is first \\namong equals in this program. That is our looking glass into \\nthe future, and we believe it needs to have a very high \\npriority in the program.\\n    We have looked at the assessment tools and processes, and \\nwe continue to see those slip as well.\\n    We have looked at the annual certification process, and \\nwhile there is no reason to question the actual certification \\nof the stockpile today, it is worrisome that a lot of \\ninformation about the future is not included in that process, \\nand that is why we have recommended to broaden it.\\n    We have a few recommendations regarding the NNSA management \\nin defining laboratory missions and how the laboratory should \\noperate these days and, of course, there has been for at least \\na decade a number of committees and panels that have reviewed \\nthe Department of Energy management processes. We would like to \\nsee some of the improvements actually be implemented.\\n    We make a recommendation on plans, programs, and budgets. \\nThe 1-year mentality for budget simply will not work for this \\nprogram in the long run. We are hopeful that we will get a \\nmultiyear budget review out of the Department of Energy and the \\nNNSA.\\n    The last two recommendations concern issues we have looked \\nat lightly this year and will look at more heavily next year: \\nthat is DOD's role in being a customer and also the issue of \\ntest readiness, and the way it is structured right now.\\n    In fact, our first meeting this year will be out at the \\nNevada Test Site in early April to go over the readiness \\nposture.\\n    Now I will step in more detail through the recommendations. \\nThese are the nine recommendations.\\n    We saw no plan to reverse the decline. To some degree \\nhistorically it is my personal opinion that the nuclear weapons \\nprogram has always been underfunded as far as capital and \\nmaintenance. But it was more troubling that there was not a \\nplan to rectify it. So we think a 10-year plan is appropriate, \\ngiven the magnitude of what we see out there, which is roughly \\na $700 to $800 million backlog of maintenance, critical \\nmaintenance, and then $300 to $500 million per annum in \\nreplacing some of that infrastructure, which is just frankly \\ntoo old to try to keep patching up.\\n    When buildings reach 40 to 50 years, their decay becomes \\nsomewhat exponential and not linear any more, and therefore in \\nsome cases we are just going to have to bite the bullet and \\nsay, I cannot keep pouring money into this place, I have to \\nbuild a smaller, more modern facility appropriate to the \\nstockpile, and Oak Ridge may be the prime candidate for that \\ntype of philosophy.\\n    Pantex and Kansas City, the other two major production \\nplants, and Savannah River to a lesser extent, are not in that \\nkind of shape.\\n    As Dr. Schlesinger said, we shut down Rocky Flats \\npermanently quite some time ago, and the United States still \\ndoes not have the capability to build a new pit, which is the \\nplutonium component and the first stage of all of our nuclear \\nweapons. What we heard was well, it is not a problem today, and \\nso we will kind of keep kicking the can down the road a ways, \\nand yet we also know that it will take probably 10 to 15 years \\nto build a facility to do this, on whatever scale and whatever \\nlocation you choose.\\n    So our feeling was, you need to get on with the conceptual \\ndesign of what this plant is going to look like and what its \\ncapacity ought to be, sized for the type of stockpile that we \\nplan to keep, and a lot of good work could be done at fairly \\nlow expense prior to final design of that plant before you \\nactually get to the high resource levels of investment.\\n    We added a recommendation on quality processes. That is \\nwhat the six-sigma notation is. Various members of the panel \\nhave had experience in this, and know the benefit of having a \\ntrue quality program in design, development, and production, so \\nwe wanted to lend an endorsement to the NNSA in making that \\npart of their approach to the program.\\n    One of the problems is that the complex is trying to manage \\npeople and facilities without a precise definition of the work \\nthat is going to use those facilities. DOE keeps pushing off \\nthe stockpile life extensions for the weapons, which is the \\ncore work yet it is still trying to maintain facilities and \\npeople, and we believe that that work really helps you figure \\nout what buildings you need to repair and how many people you \\nneed, so we would like that work not to continue to be slipped, \\nbecause what we are losing is the opportunity to train the new \\ngeneration of stewards.\\n    If you look at where the stockpile life extensions programs \\ncurrently are as far as getting into production, they are still \\nseveral years in the distance. We stopped building weapons in \\n1991, and essentially we also stopped designing weapons about \\nthat time. All the new weapons beyond the W88 Trident Warhead \\nwere canceled, so we have now gone virtually a decade without \\ndoing any real work in the integrated design, fabrication, and \\ncertification of nuclear weapons. If we continue to push that \\nout, we will not be able to transfer the skills to the new \\ngeneration of people. They will be untested by the time that \\nthey have to actually perform this work on the stockpile.\\n    Where you are not doing direct stockpile life extension \\nwork on an individual weapon, there needs to be a production \\nreadiness campaign that fills in the gap of the technologies \\nthat will be needed at some time in the future. When the cold \\nwar ended, we did make an attempt at doing that: identifying \\nall of the technologies that would be in our weapons and seeing \\nwhat we needed to actually work on, versus what capabilities we \\nneeded to maintain.\\n    When we looked at it this time, is improving, but we did \\nnot see anybody taking an integrated view that these weapons \\nrepresent some number of technologies. My recollection is that \\nwhen we did it in the early nineties we different categories, \\nand you just cannot let them evaporate, or else you will not be \\nable to repair your weapons when it comes time to do so.\\n    The last bullet on here is kind of controversial, and it \\ngot some attention in last year's report--about designing \\nalternative robust warheads, in view of the National policy of \\nno new weapons. But you have to realize the potential effects \\nof accumulated changes to the very sophisticated weapons we \\nhave right now--some of which have very thin performance \\nmargins because you are trading off safety of the weapon \\nagainst reliability and the use of nuclear materials. So you \\nwant it to be as safe as possible, which means use as little \\nnuclear material as you can, but you also want it to work when \\nrequired, and you are trying to make that balance.\\n    It may turn out that in the future the U.S. would feel more \\ncomfortable and more confident in a simpler design warhead than \\nthe high-performance warheads that we have right now, so we do \\nnot think that you should abandon study of that issue. You may \\nwant to make that trade in the future.\\n    Surveillance we kind of feel is first among equals. We have \\nalways had a robust surveillance program for the nuclear \\nweapons, but it has always been based on the fact that we are \\nturning the weapons over fairly quickly, 8 to 10 years. A new \\ngeneration of weapons.\\n    While we surveilled them we never gave ourselves the \\nopportunity to exactly know where the end of the ``bathtub \\ncurve'' is on the failure probability. Things will go along at \\na certain rate, and then when they age to a certain point, the \\nfailure rate goes up.\\n    We never allowed this--just happenstance, the way the \\nprogram was formed--we never allowed ourselves to find out \\nwhere that was, so surveillance today has to be more forward-\\nlooking to give us advanced warning a greater distance into the \\nfuture about the effectiveness of the stockpile.\\n    Therefore, we used to do random sampling of all the weapons \\nin the stockpile. We still believe in random sampling, but we \\nthink you need to rethink about taking additional samples based \\non day-to-day needs that are peculiar to different weapons \\nbased on their history, so we want a more flexible approach, a \\nmore comprehensive approach. Yu could tailor a surveillance \\nprogram more to a particular weapon's defect history or \\nsusceptibility to aging.\\n    Also, we think there are high-leverage technologies. \\nCurrently, for each weapon type in the weapons stockpile, we \\ngenerally take about 10 or 11 weapons back each year, to \\nPantex, and disassemble them. Right now, of that 10 or 11, only \\none or two weapons get their nuclear components destructively \\ntested. We believe by putting in technologies at Pantex like a \\nvariation on what is commonly called a CT scan that for certain \\ntypes of defectiveness we can look inside of these weapons \\nwithout having to take them apart and increase our data base \\nand our knowledge about the nuclear components in those \\nweapons.\\n    That is not very expensive to do, but it provides you a \\ngreat deal more insight into the character of your stockpile, \\nand so we would like to see those things pushed hard and \\ndeveloped as quickly as possible.\\n    As far as the tools and the processes for future \\ncertification, we see the schedules for all the campaigns \\npertaining to weapons' primary and secondary performance \\nslipping farther into the future. Again, you have the same \\nproblem. You have still a reasonable number of experienced \\npeople who have done this job trying to train people who have \\nnot, and the tools that they will need under a no-testing \\nenvironment are much more sophisticated than we had before. Yet \\nwe keep seeing their completion all moving farther into the \\nfuture.\\n    Congress did ask for a report from DOE on the criteria for \\nthe tools. We believe that DOE did a good first cut at the \\ntechnical part of that. What do these machines have to do? Why \\ndo they have to do it? We believe that this needs to continue \\nto be developed each year as we learn more about the tools that \\nwe need. But the problem with it is we do not see what the \\nmechanism is to make it happen. What I will call the program \\nmanagement aspects of it: how you plan it, budget it, have \\nmultiyear milestones, and how you hit those milestones. So \\nwhile the technical content of what these tools ought to do is \\nfairly well-defined, how you are going to make it happen \\nconcerns us. We hope that comes from an improvement in the \\nbudget and planning processes that Congress has asked for.\\n    As far as the annual certification process, we see the \\nstockpile assessment team (SAT) from STRATCOM become better and \\nbetter. They are very capable people and we respect their \\nopinions.\\n    We are trying to make a point on this slide about the \\nstockpile. The way these weapons were developed, a nuclear \\nlaboratory owned them. It was either a Los Alamos weapon or a \\nLivermore weapon. Well, eventually here we are going to be down \\nto about seven weapon types in the enduring stockpile, and we \\nbelieve all three laboratories need to own those weapons, that \\nall three of them ought to be certifying that they are safe and \\nreliable, and we would like to see the processes developed to \\nenable that. We think that today that the absence of testing \\nrequires that Los Alamos not completely own the W88. In terms \\nof certification we believe, for instance, Livermore ought to \\nhave a say in certifying that weapon.\\n    We were concerned about the reporting process for \\ncertification, unclassified letters. We could not quite \\nunderstand how that could lead to a system whereby you can \\nactually get out on the table what the issue is, and so we \\nrecommended, and Congress agreed, that we should classify the \\ntop level certifications.\\n    We believe that beyond saying that the weapon works today, \\nin many cases what we are really saying is, we do not know of \\nany reason why it does not work, and for a lot of aspects of \\nthis program, you have to be careful to understand that \\ndistinction.\\n    For instance, pit life is one that I would throw in that \\nsame category. When somebody says I think a plutonium pit will \\nlast 60 years, what they are really saying is, I do not really \\nknow of any reason why it will not last 60 years. That is a \\ndifferent answer.\\n    So we want to broaden certification to be more forward-\\nlooking and give an assessment to the Government about where we \\nthink these people and facilities are going to be 5, 10 years \\nin advance. We do not want to water down the technical process \\nthat is going on that says that W88 is fine, but we think the \\nGovernment needs more than that answer.\\n    As far as NNSA is concerned, and the low morale, we believe \\nthat the Baker Hamilton report is sensible. We think people \\nought to follow that, and we did not try to go in any more \\ndepth than that on the particular issue of security.\\n    We still believe it is very important for people to \\nreinforce the mission. We had an opportunity to interview the \\nnew generation of stockpile stewards, the 30, 35-year-olds. It \\nis very important to them that they believe that they are \\nworking on something important, and so the mission and how it \\nis characterized by the Government is very important. The best \\nand brightest always have other opportunities, and they need to \\nbe told why they are doing it especially when they have this \\noverburden of other issues like security being laid on top, in \\na sometimes nonproductive way.\\n    We think that Congress' restoration of the LDRD was the \\nright thing to do. We do believe lab directors need the \\nflexibility to attract talent LDRD as leading edge technology \\nis a good way to do that. We think you did the right thing.\\n    Here again, we are reinforcing roles and responsibilities \\nfor the stockpile. It is a national responsibility. Weapons \\nshould not be owned by one nuclear laboratory or the other.\\n    We think in the end, if stewardship is all about confidence \\nin the people, the technical people who are making the \\njudgments about these weapons, then we have to find ways for \\nthem to have constructive competition. We see in some cases \\nprograms like Dual Revalidation, which we thought was a good \\nprocess for evaluating the condition of a weapon, we see it \\nsometimes abandoned for what we believe the wrong reasons. The \\nwrong reason is, it was too hard to do.\\n    Well, why was it too hard to do? Well, part of the energy \\nlost had to do with things other than technical aspects of the \\nprogram, so we think it is important for the laboratories to \\nfind ways to constructively compete on this certification issue \\nand their responsibility for the weapons.\\n    I will speak personally here. Having done the job of going \\nfrom design to development to production and surveillance, when \\nI look at the stockpile stewardship program today I do not \\nreally see any missing technical elements. There is not a piece \\nof the program missing. What I see missing are the processes \\nfor balancing all of those things. In the initial stages of the \\nstockpile stewardship program we initially had to focus on the \\nissue of no nuclear testing and on the other tools we needed \\nfor above-ground experiments and computing.\\n    I think it is time to go back and look at the other end of \\nthat, and look at the other things that we do in balancing out \\nthe program like the design, development, and production \\naspects of it.\\n    What most people do not realize is that most of the very \\nlarge technical effort was not devoted to nuclear testing. \\nThere is a huge number of skills that are required to deal with \\nthese weapons. The bulk of what the integrated laboratory and \\nconstruction complex did that has been atrophying since the \\nearly nineties. So we are looking at a little bit more balance, \\nnot that the tools are not important. They are, but we are \\nlooking for a little bit more balance in the program.\\n    We are going to spend a little bit more time this year on \\nthis issue of Dual Revalidation versus baselining. The \\nDepartment has proposed baselining. We are not quite sure, it \\nlooks like it has too little rigor, or less rigor than we would \\nlike to see in the program, and so we will look at that in a \\nlittle more depth last year. The roles and responsibilities \\nthing is a decade old. Some day I wish it would go away.\\n    On the multiyear program and budget, we made a \\nrecommendation. We would like to see surveillance treated as a \\nfirst among equals--very high leverage potential there for \\nhelping us through managing through the situation. We want to \\nsee the life extension program put together. But all of this \\nbalancing and moving forward cannot be done with a year-to-year \\nbudget outlook. It needs at least a 5-year look, and hopefully \\nas the NNSA develops, it will provide you all the confidence to \\nrestore some of the flexibility to them to manage this complex \\nprogram.\\n    I will not spend very much time on DOD, except to say we \\nare going to do more of that this year. We really do think \\nthere needs to be a focus on this program and a spokesman for \\nthis program in the Pentagon of helping coordinate these \\nrequirements. You can possibly save yourself a lot of trouble \\nand money by being closely coordinated with DOD, operational \\nfixes may be suitable to problems that develop with the \\nweapons--so that's an added reason for being well coordinated.\\n    We have looked briefly at DTRA, Defense Threat Reduction \\nAgency. Hostile environments or vulnerability requirements are \\nstill in the stockpile. To target sequences for weapons. It is \\nan issue that needs to be paid attention to, and we will look \\ninto that in a little bit more depth this coming year.\\n    Lastly, another fairly controversial issue this year, is \\nthe issue of test readiness. The members of the panel have very \\ndiverse backgrounds, but I think we all agree that when \\nsomebody says it will take 2 to 3 years to run a nuclear test, \\nthat does not make any sense to us. That is not the way things \\nare likely to happen. It will work for certain types of \\nproblems. But that type of posture will not work for problems \\nthat we have already experienced, including one that I had to \\ndo about a decade ago.\\n    So we are going to look at the test posture. What does it \\nreally mean? Are there simple, smart things that you could do \\nto give more flexibility to the Government to act more promptly \\nin case there was a need to test?\\n    As far as next steps for this year, we will again continue \\nworking with the labs and plants. We will review test readiness \\nin DTRA, continue to observe the annual certification process, \\nlook at the tools, see how the programming develops, the 5-year \\nmultiyear budget approach, and monitor progress on the actual \\ninvestment that is going into the facilities.\\n    The last thing which is new in our final year that we would \\nlike to leave for Congress is a set of expectations or \\nindicators on how to judge the health of this program going \\ninto the future. We would like to be able to identify for you \\nwhat parameters you ought to consider in order to judge whether \\nthe program is healthy enough that is, in summary, the report.\\n    I can go back, if you would like to focus on certain \\nissues, if you have any questions.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Guidice follows:]\\n\\n                 Prepared Statement by Stephen Guidice\\n\\n    Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee. I will summarize the \\nprincipal findings and recommendations of our Panel. It has been a \\npleasure, an education and an honor for me to work with my fellow \\npanelists: Secretary Schlesinger, Dr. Foster, Dr. Agnew, and Dr. Gold \\nover the past 2 years. The members unanimously support the findings and \\nrecommendations in our report.\\n\\n                              OBSERVATIONS\\n\\n    The Panel focused over the last year on the National capability to \\nperform the high-priority, day-to-day work of stockpile stewardship--\\nsurveillance, assessments, life extension programs, annual \\ncertification, and production. Our review included visits to the major \\nproduction facilities and the National labs, plus presentations from \\nthe DOE, plant, and laboratory organizations that play a significant \\nrole in stockpile stewardship. The Panel also observed key parts of \\nSTRATCOM's Annual Certification Process.\\n    In this past year, the Panel has observed progress in the \\ndevelopment of the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the Annual \\nCertification Process. While the Panel continues to be impressed by the \\ndedication and technical capabilities of the people doing the day-to-\\nday work, the Panel also sees the new National Nuclear Security \\nAdministration (NNSA) facing some major leadership challenges that \\ncould jeopardize the long-term success of these people and the program. \\nThe leadership challenges are many, and include the need: to develop a \\ntruly integrated program plan and budget; to make difficult judgments \\nabout the proper balance between science and the stockpile; and, to \\nrestore morale in a nuclear weapons complex continually embroiled in \\nsafety and security controversy.\\n    Of particular note this year, the Panel found, as have other \\nreviewers, a seriously neglected production plant infrastructure. As \\nthe weapons age and inevitably need repair, the production facilities \\nwill face a much larger workload than today. While alarmed at the \\nmaintenance backlog and the physical condition of some production \\nfacilities, the Panel was most concerned that there appeared to be no \\noverarching strategy to correct this situation. Likewise, the Panel was \\nalso concerned about the lack of focus and intensity of plans to \\nrestore missing production capabilities that will be needed for repair \\nof enduring stockpile weapons.\\n    It is the Panel's view that major steps are needed to put the \\nweapon program on a path that represents our best effort toward \\nsustaining confidence in the safety and reliability of the stockpile \\nover the coming decades. Congress took important steps last year when \\nit increased weapon program funding and established the NNSA. Our \\nreport recommends additional actions that the NNSA, the Department of \\nEnergy, the Department of Defense, and the Congress should take to \\nbuild on these initial steps.\\n\\n                            RECOMMENDATIONS\\n\\nA. Restore missing production capabilities and refurbish the production \\n        complex\\n    A long-term program is needed to redress critical maintenance \\nbacklogs in weapons facilities. We have recommended a 10-year program. \\nDOE estimates this backlog to be $700-800 million. Additionally, DOE \\nestimates indicate another $300-500 million per year will be needed \\nover the next 10 years to redress shortfalls in production capabilities \\nat both plants and laboratories. We found that the same major issues \\nhave been reported by other reviewers, including the DOD, the GAO, and \\nDOE itself. In recent years, the production complex has been unable to \\ncomplete some scheduled weapons work on time due to deterioration of \\nits facilities, some of which are 40-50 years old. When compared to \\nprivate industry standards based on Replacement Plant Value, the DOE's \\nannual investment has averaged only about one-half the recommended \\nrate. Some specific examples of our concerns about production \\ncapabilities follow:\\n\\n         Almost a decade after the DOE decision to permanently \\n        shutdown the Rocky Flats Plant and begin cleanup, we still have \\n        no capability to fabricate qualified plutonium pits for our \\n        enduring stockpile weapon primaries. In our principal \\n        recommendation last year, the Panel emphasized that this \\n        situation must be addressed--it will take 10 or more years to \\n        get an adequate facility.\\n         Some critical production facilities for our enduring \\n        stockpile weapon secondaries have not been brought back on-line \\n        since they were shutdown at the Oak Ridge, Y-12 Plant in 1994 \\n        for health and safety reasons. Of the three major production \\n        plants, the Y-12 Plant is in the worst overall physical \\n        condition.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n         The Pantex Plant, the Nation's only nuclear weapon \\n        assembly and disassembly facility, is in need of critical \\n        maintenance. Special-design facilities for assembling and \\n        disassembling high explosives with fissile materials are in \\n        need of repair.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n         In the post-Cold War transition to a smaller weapons \\n        complex for a smaller stockpile, some production functions were \\n        transferred to the National laboratories. There are also \\n        infrastructure problems at some laboratory facilities needed to \\n        support production activities, such as the Los Alamos Chemistry \\n        and Metallurgy Research Facility.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    In specific, we are not adequately prepared for production in \\nsupport of planned weapon life extension programs (LEPs). In general, \\nthe missing production capabilities and deteriorated facilities leave \\nus even more concerned about our ability to respond to surprises.\\n    To meet long-term needs for nuclear components, the Panel has \\nemphasized the need to begin the conceptual design of facilities needed \\nfor pit production, secondary production, and development work at the \\nnuclear laboratories. We can significantly advance our readiness with \\nrelatively small expenditures on needed conceptual design work.\\n    Our second, third and fourth recommendations deal with the planning \\nand execution of the core stockpile stewardship functions of weapon \\ndesign, production, surveillance and assessment. It has been about a \\ndecade since the last new weapon was produced and new weapon designs \\nwere canceled. Since then, we have designed and produced no new weapons \\nand relatively few components for our enduring stockpile weapons. \\nBecause the nuclear test issue tends to dominate the stockpile \\nstewardship debate, there is a tendency to forget that nuclear testing \\nwas a relatively small fraction of a very large technical effort \\ncarried out by an integrated laboratory and production complex. The \\nknowledge and skill base needed to support design, development and \\nproduction activities is large and it will be needed to support \\ncontinued maintenance of the reliability, safety and security of an \\naging stockpile. If weapon life extension programs, production \\nreadiness campaigns, and the development of better surveillance and \\nassessment tools are continually slipped, then the opportunity to \\ntransfer the knowledge and skills from experienced people to the future \\nstockpile stewards is undermined.\\n\\nB. Stop the slippage in Life Extension Programs and Production \\n        Readiness Campaigns that exercise the capability to design, \\n        fabricate and certify replacement warheads.\\n    Maintaining a complete end-to-end capability is essential for \\nsustaining confidence in the stockpile, and it is a national priority \\nestablished in the first Nuclear Posture Review. The first step is to \\ncommit to and fund the weapons work that we know will be needed over \\nthe coming decade. This includes life extension work on the W76 Trident \\nwarhead, the W80 cruise missile warhead, and the B61 bomb. Production \\nReadiness Campaigns are needed to fill the gap between those \\ncapabilities exercised in the near-term and those needed in the long-\\nterm for life extension work on other weapons.\\n    Another essential step is to initiate programs for the design of \\nrobust, alternative warheads. These would provide training for new \\ngenerations of stockpile stewards, and provide a hedge. Ten or 20 years \\nfrom now, our confidence in robust designs based on previously tested \\nweapons might exceed that in modified versions of today's weapons, \\nwhich have been so highly optimized for weight, yield, and material \\nusage that some have very thin performance margins.\\n\\nC. Increase and enhance surveillance capabilities to predict and find \\n        defects in the stockpile.\\n    This is our first line of defense in discovering emerging problems \\nin the stockpile. NNSA should aggressively exploit new surveillance \\ntools and methods; relatively small investments in available \\ntechnologies could have large payoffs--for example, non-destructive \\ntechnology for inspection nuclear components in weapons returned to \\nPantex for stockpile surveillance. For certain types of defects, our \\ndata could be increased about 10-fold by development and implementation \\nof a CT Scan-like technology.\\n    In keeping with our emphasis on early detection of defects in the \\nstockpile and practical training of a new generation of stockpile \\nstewards, laboratory designers and engineers should seek out greater \\ninvolvement in surveillance activities.\\n\\nD. Stop the slippage in the development of tools and processes needed \\n        to enable future assessments of stockpile safety and \\n        reliability.\\n    In sum, tools must be developed before experienced personnel leave \\nand before the aging process causes significant deterioration of the \\nstockpile. In response to congressional direction, we assessed the \\nscience-based tools being developed. We believe that DOE has made a \\nreasonable effort to describe the weapon physics and performance areas \\nwhere knowledge is currently incomplete and to describe the types of \\ntools needed to obtain this knowledge. We found that while some \\nspecific criteria defining the tools that are needed have been \\ndeveloped, there is not a defined process or timetable to reach closure \\nor assess progress. DOE met the congressional mandate for a report on \\nthese tools on a one-time basis; we believe that an ongoing process and \\nadditional reporting are needed. A better process for linking \\ninformation needs, criteria for stewardship tools, and programmatic \\nmilestones and budgets is needed. Specific Panel concerns include \\nunresolved issues involving the new Advanced Hydrotest Facility (AHF) \\nand the pace of data archiving.\\n\\nE. Strengthen and Broaden the Annual Certification Process\\n    We recommended in our first annual report that Annual \\nCertification, should also include the adequacy of the people, tools, \\nand methods for addressing future problems; the ability of the weapon \\ncomplex infrastructure to find and fix problems; and nuclear test \\nreadiness. It was not, and is not, the Panel's intention to dilute the \\ntechnical certification process in place today. But more than warheads \\nand bombs need to be ``certified'', if we are to maintain our \\nconfidence in the complex system that assures the reliability, safety \\nand security of our weapons. We have suggested possible approaches to \\nfulfill this need. We are encouraged that STRATCOM's Stockpile \\nAssessment Team is playing a more prominent role in assessment of the \\nbroader stewardship goals, accomplishments and shortcomings.\\n    However, we remain concerned with the need for formally defined \\nprocesses to assure that the broader perspective is provided along with \\nthe specific details about our weapons.\\n    Our sixth, seventh and eighth recommendations focus on leadership \\nand management issues for the new NNSA and the DOD.\\n\\nF. NNSA management must respond to morale issues at the labs, redefine \\n        laboratory missions, and address long-standing management \\n        concerns within DOE\\n    First and foremost, the Panel wants to ensure the continued \\nvitality of the competition of ideas within the system of national \\nlaboratories. Continued confidence in the stockpile requires continued \\nconfidence in its stewards. We must sustain a strong system of \\nlaboratories and effective processes for engaging their talents in a \\nconstructive competition of ideas on stockpile matters. Each of the \\nnuclear laboratories should provide a comprehensive review and \\nassessment of each weapon type, irrespective of its laboratory origin. \\nRigorous inter-laboratory review must be employed for major design and \\ncertification issues. Inter-laboratory reviews also must be employed in \\npreserving databases and adapting them to new computer codes. We do not \\nsupport DOE's current proposal to give each lab exclusive rights to \\nindividually baseline the data for the weapons on which it takes lead \\nresponsibility. In the upcoming year, we will continue to investigate \\nthe potential differences in rigor that may result from a \\n``baselining'' approach versus ``dual revalidation''.\\n    The labs' working environments also must be conducive to retaining \\nworld-class talent. We support the recommendations of Senator Baker and \\nRepresentative Hamilton, which are intended to provide world-class \\nsecurity while minimizing unnecessary burdens.\\n    Management initiatives within NNSA itself are also needed. \\nResponsibility and authority needs to be focused in line managers. NNSA \\nshould manage as a Headquarters and not get involved in the details of \\nprogram execution. NNSA roles and responsibilities should be aligned \\nwith Stockpile Stewardship Program deliverables.\\n\\nG. Implement an NNSA plan, schedule and realistic multi-year budget for \\n        the Stockpile Stewardship Program, agreed to by the Nuclear \\n        Weapons Council\\n    Traditional year-to-year budgeting practices have undermined the \\nstability of the program, and eroded credibility in the program's \\nmanagement. Congress has directed important steps toward an improved \\nsystem, and NNSA is working toward it. The Panel strongly encourages \\nthis work. It is our belief that establishing a realistic program and \\nbudget is essential for the health of the Stockpile Stewardship \\nProgram. An essential first step is for NNSA to develop a Future Years' \\nPlan that aligns program goals, tasks, milestones, and resources, \\nlooking out at least 5 years into the future. This will enable NNSA to \\nclarify programmatic goals and resource priorities, and to validate the \\ntotal budget requirements. Incumbent on this process is the need to \\ninclude a mechanism for balancing the requirements of indirect \\nprogrammatic support functions, such as facility safety and security, \\nwith direct programmatic requirements for assuring the reliability, \\nsafety and security of the stockpile.\\n    Collaboration between NNSA and DOD in the forthcoming Nuclear \\nPosture Review is necessary in developing a realistic program \\nresponsive to high-level strategic requirements.\\n\\nH. Department of Defense needs to become a more informed customer of \\n        the NNSA\\n    DOD must continue to develop its Nuclear Mission Management Plan as \\na genuine plan, with milestones and resources that defines the complete \\nDOD requirement. This must be congruent with the DOE Stockpile \\nStewardship Program plan. The Panel also sees a need for more focused \\nsenior leadership within DOD. To this end, it recommends that the \\nposition of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and \\nBiological and Chemical Defense Programs be filled to provide \\nleadership within DOD and promote DOD/DOE collaboration. The Panel \\nbriefly examined the Defense Threat Reduction Agency's program. The \\ndownward trend in funding for nuclear weapons effects research is of \\nconcern. There is a need for an integrated DOD and DOE nuclear weapons \\neffects modeling, simulation, and simulator program.\\n    Recommendation 1. is discussed in next steps.\\n\\n                               NEXT STEPS\\n\\n    In addition to following up on its previous recommendations, next \\nyear the Panel will focus primarily on two areas. First, the Panel \\nbelieves that NNSA needs to determine the cost and feasibility of \\nreducing nuclear test readiness response time to well below the \\ncongressionally mandated one year. Longer lead times create unnecessary \\ndifficulties for a President considering this option. We will explore \\nthese options. Second, we plan to develop a set of indicators that the \\nCongress can use to judge the health of the weapons program. It is our \\nintention to identify actions and accomplishments that you should \\nexpect to see in the coming years that would indicate the Nation is \\ndoing its best to sustain confidence in the safety and reliability of \\nthe stockpile.\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n\\n    Senator Allard. Very good.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Mr. Chairman, let me just emphasize a \\ncouple of points. First, with regard to the DOD/DOE interface, \\nthe DOE budget is very closely controlled by the Office of \\nManagement and Budget, basically on an annual basis. The DOD, \\nby contrast, has a future years defense budget that goes over 6 \\nyears at the present time. We need to mesh these two together \\nas far as the nuclear weapons program is concerned.\\n    Unless we bring them into alignment, we are going to \\ncontinue to have these kinds of budget troubles. Mr. Guidice \\nreferred to the 1-year mentality. That is 1-year mentality with \\nregard to the DOE NNSA budget.\\n    Another point to emphasize is, when these facilities were \\nlaid down 50 years ago, the standards of health and safety were \\nquite different from what they are today, and as a consequence \\nyou have greater and greater difficulties making these \\nfacilities functional, and that is the reason that we need to \\nrecapitalize some of them.\\n    The aging weapon issue, never before have we thought that \\nwe would keep specific weapons in the stockpile more or less in \\nperpetuity. In the past, as Mr. Guidice has indicated, we \\nturned over those weapons every 8 or 10 years, so that we knew \\nwhat we had. Now, without the ability to test, we have these \\naging weapons, and we need to surveil them much more carefully \\nthan we do at the present time.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Thank you, Dr. Schlesinger, and Mr. \\nGuidice, I appreciate your presentation, and for members of the \\ncommittee, I think we will move on and see if there are any \\nquestions from the members. We will limit your comment and \\nquestion time to 7 minutes, and we will call on you in the \\norder of having arrived at the committee. My question is, just \\nto start off with, do you feel that NNSA is sufficiently on \\ntrack to meet the needs of science-based stockpile stewardship \\nin terms of accountability and authority?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, we hope it is moving in that \\ndirection. In the past, it is not just the DOD that lacked \\nfocus about this program. The DOE itself lacked focus. With the \\nestablishment of the NNSA, the organization is moving in this \\ndirection, but as yet the final achievement is distant. So we \\nare hopeful, as we indicate in the report. Whether the NNSA can \\nacquire the personnel remains an open question. General Gordon \\nhas sought to attract the appropriate qualified people. He has \\nnot always been successful. However, it is the right structure, \\nand I think that is where your question goes.\\n    Senator Allard. That is correct. Is the NNSA as it is \\ncurrently operating, do you think it is sufficiently able to \\nact autonomously? This was kind of an issue of debate, how much \\nautonomy you give NNSA.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Do you feel that it is sufficiently able to \\nact autonomously?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, of course, the NNSA is responsive to \\nthe Secretary, and the balance of the DOE shares certain \\nfunctions, legal and comptroller, with both sides of the \\nagency, but yes, with regard to program, it has sufficient \\nindependence that it can operate autonomously if it has the \\nconcurrence or support of the Secretary.\\n    Senator Allard. I think your suggestion of a 5-year budget \\nand getting that laid out is a good one, and I can see the need \\nfor that. We will do what we can to push it on this side. We \\nare one committee, and we will do what we can as we move \\nforward.\\n    Has the DOE undertaken sufficient efforts to develop tools \\nto evaluate the weapons physics knowledge base?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Our review of the criteria that they have \\ndeveloped is, they have done a good first cut at the technical \\nrequirements to do this job. What we are most concerned about \\nis the implementation and acquisition of those tools and also \\nhaving that in the planning and budgeting cycle that you all \\ncould see the results. But we think the technical part of this \\nis fairly well understood, on what tools would be needed.\\n    Senator Allard. Now, in the last Defense Authorization Act \\nfor fiscal year 2000, Congress mandated that DOE was to use \\ncriteria to evaluate and develop milestones, and yet it has no \\nplan to update these criteria. Do you have any suggestions on \\nhow DOE could go about making sure that (a) effective criteria \\nare developed and updated and (b) that there is a link between \\ntechnical and resource needs?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Well, in Appendix A of our report this year, \\nwe do lay out a suggested approach for doing that: strategic \\nplanning, plans and budgets, and integration of stewardship \\ncampaigns. So we have laid that suggestion out to them in the \\nappendix of our report.\\n    Senator Allard. Now, the report states that the NIF, \\nNational Ignition Facility's primary mission should be its \\nstated primary goal, and notwithstanding the many other \\nvaluable activities and information which can be gained from \\nthe NIF project, how can we be sure that stockpile stewardship \\nstays the primary mission goal of NIF?\\n    Mr. Guidice. I do not have a good answer for that.\\n    Senator Allard. Do you feel that at their present rate of \\nefficiencies the weapon labs and production facilities are \\ncapable of both supporting work on new weapons and refurbishing \\nthe current stockpile?\\n    Mr. Guidice. No. We are not anywhere close to any position \\nof doing that at any reasonable level. Recently, which is a \\ngood sign, the Nuclear Weapons Council has approved what is \\ncalled phase 6.3 for three weapons, the W76, W80, and B61, and \\nright now we would be hard-pressed to do those life extension \\nprograms as they are scheduled right now, so the question and \\nthe concern that we have, well, when is the plan to be ready, \\nor does it always keep moving out to the future?\\n    My answer right now would be that the amount of work that \\ngoes through the system right now is not sufficient to give me \\nconfidence that we are transferring skills to new stewards and \\nthat we have plans to plug all the holes that have developed in \\nthe technologies.\\n    Senator Allard. Now, I assume that you are familiar with \\nthe submarine-launched ballistic missile warhead protection \\nprogram, and would you discuss how the principles of that \\nprogram could be applied across the current weapons inventory?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Well, first of all I believe that it is \\nembedded in our recommendation about being able to think about \\nrobust weapons as alternatives to highly sophisticated weapons \\nthat are aging, and you may have a problem with accumulated \\nchanges in certifying those weapons.\\n    As far as I am concerned you could apply that to each \\nsegment of the enduring stockpile, or groupings of enduring \\nstockpile weapons, like ICBM warheads, bombs, cruise missiles, \\nand submarine-launched warheads, so I would think it would be \\nwise to continue that philosophy, and you have done one for \\nsubmarines, why not move on to ICBM's or other aspects of the \\ntriad?\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Reed, you are next.\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. As I \\nlisten to you, Dr. Schlesinger and Mr. Guidice, in my mind I \\nhad this vision of a cash register ringing up more and more \\nbills to ensure the security of our nuclear stockpile.\\n    Just looking at the production complex issue, a backlog of \\nabout $700 to $800 million, your recommendation of about $300 \\nto $500 million a year to recapitalize, over 10 years, that is \\nabout $5 billion, and yet I do not sense that it is going to be \\nincluded in the 2002 budget. If it is not in there, what are \\nthe consequences to the complex?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The complex will continue to age and to \\ndeteriorate, and we will be straining to meet what have been \\nthe evolving health and safety standards for the complex, and \\nsome will fall short, and we will be forced to close those \\nfacilities.\\n    If we are to meet evolving standards, we need to have \\nfacilities that are reasonably up to date, and we need to \\nmaintain those facilities. If we do not maintain those \\nfacilities, we are not going to be in a position to sustain \\nconfidence in the stockpile. It is as simple as that.\\n    Senator Reed. Now, Mr. Secretary, there are several reviews \\nunderway. We will have a nuclear posture review later this \\nyear. We have an informal review going on. My sense, and I \\nwonder if it is yours, is that those reviews will add no \\nfurther information to the present evaluation you have done on \\nthe production facilities. I.e., we know right now we have a \\nhuge bill that is pending, and if we are honest we would \\ninclude that in the budget today. Is that a fair statement?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. That is correct, sir.\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Alternatively, we can give up on some of \\nthe objectives that we have set with regard to the maintenance \\nof our strategic forces, or particular aspects of the \\nstewardship program, such as the last one that was mentioned by \\nMr. Guidice, which is the degree of readiness of the test \\nreadiness program. As he indicated, we may be able to get off a \\ntest in 2 or 3 years.\\n    Senator Thurmond. If you would speak a little louder, I \\nwould appreciate it.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Is that what we wanted? We may be able to \\nget off a test in 2 or 3 years? That is by many people's \\ndefinition not a readiness program.\\n    Senator Reed. So it would have an adverse impact on \\nreadiness, to be polite.\\n    You have also talked about the stockpile surveillance \\nprogram as an important area to stress. You have recommended \\ndoing more in the surveillance program and reinstating a dual \\nrevalidation program, and both of these being a combination \\nthat would become the basis for life extension programs. Now, \\nthat is going to cost money also, separate from the production \\nfacilities.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Some of that is simply a reallocation of \\neffort, particularly within the weapons laboratories, the \\nweapons design laboratories. At the moment, they have the \\ncapability to do a Dual Revalidation, for example, but there is \\na tendency to say, well, that is your weapon, we will not \\ncomment on your weapons if you do not comment on our weapons. \\nSo the capability in that respect is largely there.\\n    Senator Reed. So you do not anticipate, in this particular \\narea, significant additional commitment of resources to carry \\nout your recommendation?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think that it is more a question of \\nchanging the strategy than it is an immense increase in \\nfunding.\\n    Senator Reed. Mr. Guidice.\\n    Mr. Guidice. If I might add on the surveillance issue, one \\nof the reasons we pushed so hard is because when you talk about \\nimproving the program, you are talking about a few tens of \\nmillions of dollars in a year, you are not talking hundreds of \\nmillions, and we think it is very high leverage money. You may \\nfind out though that you do not have to do something that you \\nthought you had to do.\\n    Senator Reed. The NNSA has talked about rebaselining or \\ndual revalidation as more or less a substitute for your \\nproposal. Could you comment upon their view, and the \\ndifferences, perhaps, within the two techniques?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Basically, I am not clear that we have a \\nthorough understanding of the definition of baselining. One \\ndefinition of baselining is that you--and the Department is \\ntrying to manage a real issue, the people aging issue--capture \\nall the data and get it written down before all these people \\nmove on.\\n    But one definition or difference would be that there are no \\nexperiments. There are no challenges, or real challenges to \\nsome of the original data about how we certified these weapons, \\nso think of it as a program that has no experimental component \\nto it. Dual Revalidation for the W76, the first and only one \\nthat they have done, did have that experimental component.\\n    But experiments are hard to do, they are costly to do, but \\nyou do provide some real data for maybe, perhaps, some of the \\nsoft spots that were in the original development program.\\n    So baselining, as we understand it right now, is just \\nbasically trying to get all the archived information down and \\ncaptured in one place, but not much more rigor than that.\\n    Senator Reed. As you go forward with your review of the \\nproblem, will you keep this issue under your scrutiny to \\ndetermine what makes sense?\\n    Dr. Guidice. Yes.\\n    Senator Reed. Throughout the testimony there has been \\ndiscussions of the rivalries between the laboratories and the \\nownership of particular weapons by particular laboratories, and \\nthere has been a recommendation to have a more cooperative \\napproach between the laboratories, but also there is that sense \\nof intellectual competition that might spur research effort, et \\ncetera. How do you balance this intellectual competition and \\nthis cooperative approach, Mr. Secretary.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, I think our New England poet, \\nSenator, Robert Frost, says good fences make good neighbors. I \\nthink it is more, that the problem of good fences make good \\nneighbors is the problem of the laboratories, rather than that \\nthere is rivalry between them. The rivalry takes the form of \\nsaying you stay out of our area and we will stay out of yours. \\nI think that encouraging, directing, and getting the laboratory \\nDirectors fully to understand the benefits to the country of \\nboth laboratories validating weapons would be beneficial to get \\nrid of that good fences make good neighbors attitude.\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you, Dr. Schlesinger. Thank you, Mr. \\nGuidice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Thurmond.\\n    Senator Thurmond. Thank you very much.\\n    I ask that my statement be placed in the record.\\n    Senator Allard. Without objection, it will be done.\\n    [The prepared statement of Senator Thurmond follows:]\\n              Prepared Statement by Senator Strom Thurmond\\n    Thank you Mr. Chairman: Secretary Schlesinger, I join the Chairman \\nin welcoming you to this hearing on the status of our nuclear weapons \\nstockpile. I also want to thank you for appearing today and for your \\nexceptional and dedicated service to our Nation.\\n    One of the more significant accomplishments during the my tenure as \\nthe Chairman of the Armed Services Committee was enactment of the Strom \\nThurmond Defense Authorization Act of 1999. In this legislation we \\ncreated the Panel to Assess the Reliability, Safety, and Security of \\nthe United States Nuclear Stockpile. For the past 2 years, this panel \\nhas painted a no nonsense picture of the state of our strategic arsenal \\nand the facilities which are responsible for maintaining that \\nstockpile. Unfortunately, that picture is not pretty. The observations \\nidentified in your two reports are striking. They highlight just how \\nmuch work needs to be done to guarantee our Nation's nuclear deterrent. \\nI assure you that I plan to do all that I can to implement your \\nrecommendations.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger, you may be aware that I am particularly concerned \\nabout the lack of progress made by the department toward fabricating \\nqualified plutonium pits and toward designing and constructing a full \\nscale pits facility. I especially look forward to hearing your thoughts \\nregarding these matters.\\n    Mr. Chairman, this is a significant hearing which will have long \\nterm implications on the state of our strategic deterrent. I \\ncongratulate you for your focus on this important report and the \\ndistinguished group of patriots who prepared it.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n\\n    Senator Thurmond. I have some questions for Dr. \\nSchlesinger.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger, you have had a distinguished public \\nservice career both as Secretary of Defense and Secretary of \\nEnergy, and have had a long association with our nuclear \\nstockpile. Has your confidence in the reliability and safety of \\nour nuclear stockpile changed in the intervening years and, if \\nso, how and why?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Senator, in the past, when we had nuclear \\ntesting, we had a surer way of establishing confidence and \\nreliability. I do not think that we need worry about declining \\nsafety of the stockpile, but I think that the question of \\nreliability is a matter of concern.\\n    In the more than a decade since we last tested our weapons, \\nconfidence in those weapons has declined. Has it declined so \\nmuch that we need to be worried? We do not know the answer to \\nthat. Probably not. Probably at this time we still have ample \\nconfidence, particularly in view of the fact that the emphasis \\nin the United States defense strategy has shifted back towards \\nconventional weapons and away from nuclear weapons, so that the \\nstrain, as it were, on our nuclear capability has lessened.\\n    Nonetheless, it must be each Member of the Senate, each \\nMember of the Congress and the executive branch that will have \\nto decide, in the face of inevitably declining confidence in \\nthe reliability of the stockpile, when and whether such \\nconfidence has eroded to the point that we are no longer \\ncapable of having a credible deterrent that will deter others.\\n    Senator Thurmond. Dr. Schlesinger, last year you identified \\nthe need to immediately begin conceptual design of a full-scale \\nplutonium pit production facility. Unfortunately, DOE failed to \\nacknowledge your advice. This year, your report again \\nhighlighted this issue, and in fact you expressed an even \\ngreater urgency, stating, 10 more years without the capability \\nto produce adequate numbers of nuclear components is pushing \\nthe limit of acceptable risk.\\n    Considering the significance of this issue, what level of \\nfunding per year do you believe is necessary to meet this \\ncompressed time frame?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Mr. President pro tem, our desire is the \\nsame as last year, except it is reinforced. We must begin \\nconceptual design of a facility to produce primaries. It will \\nprobably take a decade before we have that facility, and if in \\nthe interim one of the categories of nuclear weapons on which \\nwe depend were to be discovered to be deficient in its nuclear \\ncomponents, we would be very hard-pressed to replace them, so \\nas a matter of simple caution we must have the capability to \\nproduce primaries, and we were disappointed that Congress and \\nthe administration last year could not agree on proceeding with \\nthe design of such a facility.\\n    Senator Thurmond. Dr. Schlesinger, your report states, and \\nI quote, ``we believe the need to design, fabricate, and \\nqualify new components will increase.'' In your judgment, does \\nthe Department of Energy have the will and capability in terms \\nof facilities, funding, and people to carry out this \\nanticipated need?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I responded earlier to the chairman's \\nquestion with respect to the NNSA. The NNSA is in the process \\nof development. It was created by act of Congress a year ago. I \\nthink that it is the move in the right direction to establish \\nan entity within the Department that has full responsibility \\nand accountability, but as yet they have not passed the point \\nthat we can be assured that they will be able to deliver. \\nNonetheless, at this stage I think that there is the will, \\ncertainly in the NNSA, and I think on the part of Secretary \\nAbraham, to get on with the job.\\n    The real question, of course, is, will they have sufficient \\nresources, both financial--which is the responsibility of the \\nCongress and the administration--and whether or not they can \\nattract the appropriate personnel, and only time will tell us \\nthe answer to that.\\n    Senator Thurmond. Dr. Schlesinger, recommendation H of your \\nreport proposes that the Department of Defense needs to become \\na more informed customer of the National Nuclear Security \\nAdministration. Since Secretary Rumsfeld is currently doing a \\nreview of DOD activities and strategies, what specific \\nrecommendation do you have for him to fully implement the \\npanel's recommendation?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, I think that that is a complicated \\nquestion, Senator Thurmond, and we would be delighted to give a \\nfull answer on your record. However, in recent years the DOD \\nhas not focused on the question of nuclear weapons. It has been \\nunder severe budget pressure. This was a concern of the \\nprevious administration, and most notably, the Deputy \\nSecretary, John Hamre, in that under pressure, the nuclear \\nweapons position of the United States was suffering from benign \\nneglect, to borrow a phrase of one of your former colleagues, \\nin that there was a lack of concern with respect to the weapons \\ncarriers but after 2020 we have no missile production in the \\nUnited States.\\n    The B-52 bomber, which remains the heart of our bomber \\nforce, is supposed to carry on till the year 2040, at which \\npoint it will be over 70 years since production, and this is an \\nindication, I think, that the Department, under pressure, has \\nnot focused on the carriers, and they have been even more \\nconfident, as it were, about the weapons themselves. But as our \\nnumber of our strategic delivery systems declines, the \\nimportance of the individual weapon being reliable increases in \\norder to maintain a deterrent that is credible.\\n    Senator Thurmond. Thank you. My time is up.\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Dayton.\\n    Senator Dayton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I returned this \\nafternoon from Fort Bragg, where I had the unpleasant \\nresponsibility of attending a memorial service for a serviceman \\nwho was killed in Kuwait just last week from Minnesota, and it \\nunderscored, Mr. Secretary, where you said this is not about \\nproviding lip service, it is about life and death, and it seems \\nto me that the least response and responsibility that we have \\nin the legislative branch and in the executive branch is to \\nmake sure that that ultimate sacrifice of a brave man's life \\nand his family's despair is not in vain.\\n    I may refer to Mr. Secretary, I think we refer to Senators \\nlong after they are no longer discharging the office, and I \\nthink Secretaries of Defense may be warranted to have that \\nhonorific longer than Senators, certainly than most, and I \\nexpress my gratitude to you for your continued service to our \\ncountry in this important capacity.\\n    I was very, very alarmed, Mr. Secretary, about what you \\nsaid about hard hats in these facilities, debris falling upon \\nthem. I was touring just last week a nuclear power plant in \\nMinnesota, and I was struck by the impeccable condition of that \\nfacility from everywhere from the roof all the way through, and \\nit seems to me that this contrast is a very stark indicator of \\nthe failure of our Government to provide for truly the National \\nsecurity from within.\\n    I guess I missed some of the earlier questioning, I am \\nsorry, but what are the one, two, and three recommendations you \\nwould have specifically, and how much would they cost to repair \\nthis kind of neglect?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. What we proposed is something on the order \\nof a $300 million a year--perhaps somewhat more than that--\\nrecapitalization program, and a program over a decade to get \\nrid of the maintenance backlog which we estimate at $800 \\nmillion.\\n    Senator Dayton. Now, these are physical repairs, sir?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. These are physical repairs or physical \\nconstruction.\\n    Senator Dayton. I remember your saying just a while ago \\nthat these weapons are now 10 years or more old. I would not \\nbuy or want to rent a car that was 10 or 12 or more years old. \\nShould I be more or less reassured about a nuclear weapon that \\nour country is depending on that is that age?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Senator, the weapons in the stockpile tend \\nto be 20 years of age, and they were originally estimated that \\nthe shelf life was 15 years, so we are 5 years, as it were, \\nover the original estimate of the shelf life.\\n    I would be deeply concerned. I have used the story of \\ntorpedoes that the Navy carried over from World War I to World \\nWar II without ample tests, and when we sent our torpedo \\nbombers in at the Battle of Midway in 1942, none of those \\ntorpedoes worked, or adequately struck Japanese vessels. We \\nwere lucky at Midway, which was the crucial battle of the \\nPacific War, that we also had the dive bombers, which won the \\nBattle of Midway for us, but the torpedo analogy is not a bad \\none, particularly when it is 20 years that these weapons have \\nbeen in the stockpile.\\n    We have a surveillance program, and we have long had a \\nsurveillance program in which we take the components, and we \\ntest the components, and if the components appear to be \\ndefective, we replace them, but these are the nonnuclear \\ncomponents.\\n    The nuclear components are aging. They are radioactive. \\nParts of the weapon are organic materials which do not do well \\nunder radiation bombardment, so that is why I believe that we \\nmust face the fact that with the aging of the weapons and the \\nabsence of testing, that there is some decline in the \\nconfidence in the reliability of the stockpile. Whether that is \\na sharp decline or is a reasonably level decline is something \\nthat each individual, I guess, would have to judge for himself, \\nand whether that has reached the peril point.\\n    Senator Dayton. It is difficult to find out until you need \\nto know.\\n    Mr. Chairman, one last question, if I may, of either of \\nyou. You also said that we no longer have in this country the \\ncapability to produce a primary nuclear weapon.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The primary that drives the nuclear \\nweapon.\\n    Senator Dayton. Right. Is that as alarming as it sounds?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. It is alarming to me, sir. The chairman \\nmay be more ambivalent than I, but I was alarmed when Rocky \\nFlats was shut down in 1989, and I have grown more alarmed over \\nthe years with the absence of the capability to produce a \\nprimary.\\n    As Mr. Guidice has indicated, we have very sophisticated \\nnuclear weapons which were optimized for weight and for yield, \\nand as a result we have thin performance margins in those \\nnuclear weapons, and for that reason, any deterioration in the \\nnuclear heart of a weapon is a source of considerable concern. \\nWe ought to have the capability of replacing a substantial \\nnumber of primaries, even if we do not have to use that \\ncapability.\\n    Senator Dayton. Mr. Guidice, would you care to comment, \\nsir?\\n    Mr. Guidice. No, that said it well.\\n    Thank you both. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Thank you. Senator Nelson from Nebraska.\\n    Senator Nelson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    As you described the infrastructure deterioration, and you \\npoint out the question about replacement of the primaries in \\ntesting along the way to make sure that the aging of the \\nweapons is not the same as deterioration of the weapons, and \\nraise the budget concerns, are the budget amounts which you \\nmentioned, the $300 million for a multiyear program, does that \\ninclude what would also be involved in testing and replacing \\nmany of the component parts, or are we talking primarily maybe \\nentirely, about the infrastructure, the crumbling facilities?\\n    Mr. Guidice. The $300 to $500 million per annum is facility \\nrebuilding and infrastructure, repairing that type of problem. \\nIt has nothing to do with the surveillance or with those \\nexpenditures for weapon components.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. But those expenditures would be relatively \\nmuch lower than that--as indicated by Mr. Guidice in the tens \\nof millions, rather than the hundreds of millions.\\n    Senator Nelson. As we look at this, and of course the \\nclosure of Rocky Flats, is there also an environmental \\ncomponent that makes it a greater challenge for us to be able \\nto continue to do what we need to do, even in replacing the \\nfacilities?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Yes, sir. I mentioned earlier the safety \\nand health standards have been rising. As you indicate, the \\nenvironmental standards have also risen. For that reason, we \\nhave not been able to take the methods of production that \\nexisted at Rocky Flats and simply transfer them to Los Alamos \\nor wherever we build that alternate facility. We have to \\nupgrade them to meet the now-enhanced environmental standards.\\n    Senator Nelson. Do we have the capacity to do that?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think we have the capacity to do that, \\nyes, sir.\\n    Mr. Guidice. But what you are faced with in some places, \\nand Oak Ridge is a good example, is, are these buildings so old \\nand so deteriorated and so many of the safety features have \\nbeen grafted into these old facilities, is it better to keep \\nreinvesting in that, or patching it up, or do you really just \\nneed to build a small, modern facility to meet the current \\nstandards, and start cleaning that old stuff up.\\n    Senator Nelson. It still boils down to a matter of money, \\nwhen all said and done.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Just to use a metaphor here, Senator \\nNelson, the Atomic Energy Commission budget when Dwight \\nEisenhower was President of the United States was about 4 \\npercent of the Federal budget. It is now down to a fraction of \\n1 percent, which over the years did not matter that much, but \\nnow that we face these very aged and in some cases decrepit and \\nfragile facilities, we have to recognize how much these \\nfacilities did originally cost.\\n    Senator Nelson. Then there is the additional question of \\nthe delivery systems such as the aging B-52's.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Yes, indeed, and how is Offutt Air Force \\nBase, Senator?\\n    Senator Nelson. I was just there recently for a briefing. \\nIt is still in great shape. The deterioration you have spoken \\nabout other places has not carried over to Offutt, I am pleased \\nto say.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, those youngsters who used to say \\nthat the airplanes that they flew were older than they were, \\nthey can now say that those planes are getting as old as their \\ngrandfathers were.\\n    Senator Nelson. Unfortunately I believe you are accurate, \\ntoo. Thank you very much.\\n    Senator Dayton. I was out at Pope Air Force Base today. \\nThey said they had planes so slow they worry about the birds \\nfrom behind, not the front. [Laughter.]\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Akaka from Hawaii.\\n    Senator Akaka. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Are you finished, Senator Nelson?\\n    Senator Nelson. I am finished, thank you.\\n    Senator Allard. Yes, OK. Senator Akaka. Sorry.\\n    Senator Akaka. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a brief \\nstatement that I would like to include in the record.\\n    Senator Allard. Without objection, so ordered.\\n    [The prepared statement of Senator Akaka follows:]\\n\\n             Prepared Statement by Senator Daniel K. Akaka\\n\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to welcome Mr. Schlesinger \\nthis afternoon.\\n    The effectiveness of the Stockpile Stewardship program plays a \\nvital role with respect to our national security. The issue of whether \\nor not the United States can sustain sufficient confidence in the \\nsafety and reliability of its nuclear deterrence capability while \\ncomplying with the terms of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is \\nintegral to the decisions we make with respect to this important \\nprogram.\\n    I have reviewed the recommendations made by the panel and look \\nforward to your testimony this afternoon.\\n\\n    Senator Akaka. Dr. Schlesinger, it is good to see and hear \\nyou again, and to hear your comments about this program. I am \\nparticularly interested in one part of this program, and under \\nthe elements for stewardship, it includes talented, well-\\ntrained people, adequate weapons and so forth, but I am \\ninterested in the people, and stewardship.\\n    The panel supports the National Ignition Facility, due to \\nthe critical insights into stewardship this program could \\noffer. Besides stockpile stewardship, which the panel states \\nshould be the prime stated goal of the National Ignition \\nFacility, this facility will also be used by researchers. This \\nfacility could be used by the next generation of nuclear \\nphysicists to replace those critical positions in the \\nDepartment of Energy's laboratories.\\n    This is my question. Is the panel concerned that such an \\nemphasis on stockpile stewardship and classified research at \\nthe National Ignition Facility could detract from the \\nlaboratories' basic research programs, which could otherwise \\nencourage young scientists?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think that is fundamentally a budget \\nquestion, Senator. I think that there has been an attitude in \\nWashington that Livermore overran its estimate on the National \\nIgnition Facility, and that therefore it should be in some \\nsense forced to eat part of that overrun. Obviously, under \\nthose circumstances it will somewhat constrain the balance of \\nits research program.\\n    Senator Akaka. I ask that question because as we look at \\nthe future, and the future stewardship, we are going to need \\nthe young minds, as we have been talking about age here, and \\nequipment. We are going to need those young scientists in the \\nfuture to come in and continue this stewardship, and that was \\nmy concern.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, it is a very appropriate concern, \\nSenator. In this post cold war period there must be something \\nscientifically exciting to attract personnel to the \\nlaboratories, and the NIF was one of those elements that \\nprovided scientists excitement, and I think that may be the \\nmost important aspect of the NIF, even given its role in \\nstockpile stewardship.\\n    Senator Akaka. Thank you very much.\\n    Senator Allard. Thank you, Senator. I would like to follow \\nthat up just a little bit. Over the last few years, there has \\nbeen a push with the labs to get more involved with economic \\ndevelopment activities, and they set up private business \\npartnerships and other activities which do not seem to support, \\nin my view at least, the stewardship mission. Do these \\nactivities detract, or do you think they enhance the core \\nstewardship mission for the labs?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. That in my judgment at least, Mr. \\nChairman, depends upon the choice of activities. Many of those \\nactivities will add to the spirit of excitement within the \\nlaboratory. On the other hand, a laboratory, because of \\nbudgetary concerns, could be induced to engage in what is \\nuninteresting work, or in the eyes of some, make-work, and in \\nthat respect they would certainly detract from the attraction \\nof the laboratory and the ability of the laboratory to perform \\nits fundamental tasks on stockpile stewardship.\\n    Senator Allard. Our inability to attract new talent and \\nwhat-not into the laboratories, do you think that is a function \\nof solely money, or is it part a function of program, or is it \\na function of not seeing a future there 10, 20, 30 years down \\nthe road?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. It is a function of many things, Mr. \\nChairman. Steve is more familiar with these things, but let me \\nsay that for those who worked in the weapons program there was \\na psychological pay-off when you were able to test the weapons. \\nWhen you are dealing with maintenance of aging weapons, there \\nis just that much less of a psychological pay-off.\\n    There has been the problem in the laboratories of what is \\nseen as excessive pressures on security, such that the time \\ninvolved in dealing with the security aspects of the individual \\nresearcher has risen from 10 percent to 20, 30 percent of his \\ntotal time. Well, for one thing, that reduces the amount of \\ntime available for real research, if the researchers are \\ndevoting their time to fulfilling various security-related \\nactivities.\\n    Senator Allard. Has that phenomenon just happened in the \\nlast 10 years, over last year, or over the last 4 or 5 or 6 \\nyears?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think it is really these last 2 or 3 \\nyears, since the eruption of concern, appropriate concern about \\nwhether or not the People's Republic of China had been able to \\nexploit the openness of the laboratory, and those are concerns \\nthat must be dealt with.\\n    There has also been a reaction--there was the reaction to \\nthe Wen Ho Lee case, which in some respects at least appears to \\nhave been exaggerated, but the fundamental point here, Mr. \\nChairman, in my judgment at least, is that the way to deal with \\nthis problem is to raise the security consciousness of people \\nin the laboratories. That is the central feature. If they are \\nsecurity conscious, they will be able to respond effectively in \\ncertain circumstances, and compared to that, many of the \\nofficial requirements and many of the foci of activities become \\nsecondary.\\n    We spend a lot of time building fences to keep people out, \\nbut if you think about aspiring nuclear countries, including \\nthose that already have the weapon and want to upgrade the \\nweapon, you can figure out those particular things in which \\nsuch countries are interested, and those are the areas that we \\nought to seek to protect and to raise the security \\nconsciousness of those involved in them, rather than simply \\nbuilding fences.\\n    The intrusion behind fences has been very limited over the \\nyears. The intrusion into the laboratories because of a lack of \\nsufficient security consciousness has been much greater, and we \\nought to focus on those elements that would be of particular \\ninterest to proliferators.\\n    Senator Allard. I would like to go back to this dual \\nrevalidation issue. If we have one laboratory that is involved \\nin the design and the testing and the manufacturing of data of \\na particular warhead, just how important is it that we include \\nscientific oversight and input from the other laboratories?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, going back to that earlier question, \\nand Steve, you should get into this, going back to that earlier \\nquestion of how much confidence that we have in the stockpile, \\nthese are aging weapons, and when we were turning over the \\nstockpile every 8 or 10 years, and we had large numbers of \\nweapons in the stockpile, the existing system in which each \\nlaboratory owned its own weapons was sufficient to give one a \\nhigh degree of confidence.\\n    Here, we are looking out over 20, 30 years of essentially \\nthe same weapons in the stockpile with changed components, and \\na much reduced number of weapons types in the stockpile. Under \\nthese circumstances, it seems to me, there is much greater \\nadvantage in having one laboratory looking over the shoulder of \\nthe other laboratory as it contemplates the condition of its \\nweapons.\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Reed--did you have a comment, Mr. \\nGuidice?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Well, technically, in the past, we have only \\nbeen able to look at defects in one or two dimensions of \\nanalysis, but all defects in the nuclear package are in three \\ndimensions, and although we are now trying to look at them in \\nthree dimensions, the answers are not clear. Defects cause \\nasymmetries in the implosion and the functioning of the weapon, \\nand it is terribly important that independent eyes look at the \\ndata and try to make a good technical judgment about what the \\nconsequences of the defect would be. I think it is vitally \\nimportant.\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Reed.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Are we at the three dimensions yet?\\n    Dr. Guidice. We are starting, we are in the first part of \\nthe use of three dimensional analysis capability.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. To this point, those computer models have \\nbasically been two-dimensional, and we are getting to the \\npoint, just beginning to get to the point where we can look at \\nthese weapons in three dimensions. That, incidentally, I think \\nreinforces the argument for dual revalidation, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Good point. Senator Reed.\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Secretary, DOE has been trying to develop a multiyear \\nbudget for about 13 years, and the requirement in the fiscal \\nyear 2000 National Defense Authorization Act is, I believe, at \\nleast a fourth statutory effort to obtain a multiyear budget, \\nbut, as you point out, the culprit is the Office of Management \\nand Budget. How do we fix that? How do we deal with that \\nobstacle?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, I am not sure that as an old DOD-OMB \\nman that I would like to describe the OMB as the culprit.\\n    Senator Reed. Who better than you, Mr. Secretary.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think that it is my judgment that the \\nCongress can, and I would suggest should, mandate that the \\nDepartment of Defense budgeting and the DOE budgeting be \\nbrought into alignment, and that, as long as the Department of \\nDefense is operating on a future years defense program of 6 \\nyears, that we should also be looking to the defense programs \\nof the DOE to be looking out that way, and that it is a strong \\nexpression of concern that the OMB collaborate in achieving \\nthat objective. I think that a strong expression of concern on \\nthe part of the Congress would bring about a much broader and \\nlonger-term attitude on the part of the OMB.\\n    Senator Reed. In that sense, Mr. Secretary, would a much \\nmore forceful embrace of the DOE by DOD be helpful in that \\nsense. One perception I have is that with the demise of the \\nSoviet Union, the centrality of nuclear weapons has changed \\ndramatically, and it has created both a mind set and a \\nprioritization which has diminished significantly nuclear \\ndeterrence.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Rightly so. The strategy of the United \\nStates is no longer to initiate the use of nuclear weapons in \\nthe event of successful Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe, \\nand therefore, since initiation is not our concern, and since \\nwe also, in dealing with other nations, including Saddam \\nHussein, have stressed conventional capabilities as our \\neffective deterrent, the emphasis on nuclear weaponry should \\nhave declined, but it may have declined too far.\\n    The DOD is under heavy budgetary pressure itself, and as a \\nconsequence it has lost the focus on nuclear weaponry, at least \\ntemporarily. Secretary Hamre tried to restore this in the \\nrecent administration, and he continues to be concerned about \\nthat. I think that we will see how interested in rebalancing \\nthat perception, that perspective on the part of the new \\nadministration will ultimately be.\\n    Senator Reed. In the light of all these pressures on the \\nrelationship of DOD to DOE, would a significant reduction in \\nthe nuclear weapons stockpile, both deployed weapons, and \\nweapons in a nondeployed stockpile, improve the situation in \\nterms of safeguarding the security of the weapons?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I do not think that the security of the \\nweapons is that----\\n    Senator Reed. The reliability.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The reliability, no, because the weapons \\nwould still continue to age. We only have, what, seven weapons \\ntypes remaining in the inventory, and those weapons are 20 \\nyears old. They continue to age 1 year every year. We are doing \\nsurveillance. We are replacing components, but the reliability \\nwill decline, and it is not a question of the number of \\nweapons, I believe.\\n    As the number of weapons goes down, the great concern is \\nthat the reliability must be maintained, or possibly enhanced, \\nsimply because the deterrent, which we use, at least \\nrhetorically, to deter not only nuclear attacks but chemical \\nand biological attacks against ourselves and some of our \\nallies--we must have a high degree of confidence in that \\nstockpile, and that degree of necessary confidence per unit \\nincreases as the number of units diminishes.\\n    Senator Reed. If I may I have one final question. You have \\ntalked about, and the panel has recommended, the design of \\nrobust alternative warheads, of which the design, and perhaps \\neven the fabrication, would be permissible under the \\nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but to what extent would you \\ndesign, even fabricate a system, and not want to, or have the \\nneed to, test it?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. I think that there will be those who would \\nwant to test, and certainly people in the laboratory engaged in \\ndesigning these weapons would very much like to test, but that \\nis a matter of national policy.\\n    President Bush, or Candidate Bush said that we would \\ncontinue to observe the moratorium, even though we ourselves \\nwould not ratify the treaty, and as long as that is the rule, I \\nthink that that will certainly be enforced upon personnel in \\nthe laboratories. However, I think that it does two things. \\nFirst, it does provide you with a backup against these \\nsophisticated weapons with relatively thin performance margins, \\nand second it keeps some people engaged in the design process.\\n    Perhaps the greatest problem that we have is the problem of \\nhuman capital. The number of people in the laboratory system \\nwho have ever observed a nuclear test or participated in a \\nnuclear test is declining, and within 10 years they will all be \\ngone. The numbers who have participated in the design of \\nnuclear weapons are rapidly fading out.\\n    One of the advantages of having them design nuclear weapons \\nwithout testing is that it tends to keep that kind of \\nprofessional capability alive.\\n    Senator Reed. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, Mr. \\nChairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Senator Dayton.\\n    Senator Dayton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Reed, \\nregarding the reference to the OMB, I have often thought that \\nwhat we need to do is develop a bureaucratic version of the \\nneutron bomb that would leave all the people standing but \\nobliterate the bureaucracy. We could work on that maybe at one \\nof our next advanced facilities.\\n    Senator Reed. A job for Livermore.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. That is an ambitious goal, Senator.\\n    Senator Dayton. An ancillary but still related issue is, \\nand we are struggling with this in the Congress, is the \\ndesignation and development of a permanent nuclear repository. \\nHow does the failure of our country to develop such a site \\nimpact, if it does at all, these aging nuclear weapons, the \\nmaterials, the desire, as you say, or the need to upgrade them \\nand develop new capabilities?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, that is a very complex question that \\nwould require extended discussion, but basically we now have a \\nsite to deal with the waste from the weapons program. It is the \\nsite in New Mexico called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant \\n(WIPP). I think you may be concerned about the arguments over \\nthe site in Nevada, which deals with waste, or the individual \\nnuclear packages from nuclear reactors. That continues to be a \\nmatter of great concern, but we are working effectively, if too \\nslowly, on disposing of the waste from the weapons program \\nitself.\\n    There has been progress in Idaho. I think there is progress \\ncontinuing at Hanford. There is work going ahead at Savannah \\nRiver, so I think that in that area we have less concern than \\nabout how to deal with the byproducts of the nuclear reactor \\nprograms in this country, which has a much stronger ideological \\nelement in it, may I say, than with regard to the weapons \\nprogram.\\n    Senator Dayton. I learned something new. I thought that it \\nwas all going to end up at Yucca Mountain, or some alternative.\\n    Mr. Guidice. Nuclear weapon production does not generate \\nhigh-level waste. They typically generate low-level and some \\ntransuranic, which is a mixture of chemical and low-level, so \\nthe Yucca Mountain is high-level waste from reactors, but the \\nweapons program itself does not generate that kind of waste.\\n    Senator Dayton. Thank you.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. These reactors, the fuel in them runs to \\n30,000 megawatt days. They can be very, very radioactive, \\nwhereas with the weapons program basically you are just dealing \\nwith the byproducts of production, much simpler.\\n    Senator Dayton. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Senator Allard. Thank you. I have about four questions \\nhere, and then I think we can call everything to a close. I \\nappreciate your comments this afternoon and the time you have \\ndedicated to the committee.\\n    Both of you indicated that to increase efforts and \\nsurveillance capabilities to predict and find defects in the \\nstockpile as atop priority. I guess the question related to \\nthat, do you believe BOB and NNSA has made surveillance a top \\npriority, and are they responding to your concerns in that \\nregard?\\n    Dr. Guidice. I think they have, at least I am told they \\nhave in the last budget year.\\n    Senator Allard. What about the Congress? I mean, the agency \\nis responding. Do you think the Congress is responding?\\n    Dr. Guidice. I do not know where the negotiation is in \\nthat. I do know that the Department has tried to make an effort \\nto put more money into surveillance on a scale that we thought \\nwas appropriate.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. We will be better able to reach a judgment \\non that, Mr. Chairman, in about 7 or 8 months time.\\n    Senator Allard. I thought you would answer in that way.\\n    With the loss of scientists with actual testing environment \\nexpertise and experience, is there a fear that we could be \\nmoving toward an era in which our stewards are more experienced \\nwith computer codes than nuclear physics, and does that create \\na concern for the reliability, safety, and security of the \\nstockpile?\\n    Dr. Guidice. Absolutely. I mean, that is why it is \\nimportant not to allow these stewardship milestones to keep \\nslipping into the future until everybody else has died off who \\ncould train them, and who has any practical experience to \\ntemper their judgment----\\n    Senator Allard. Experience is the bottom line in a lot of \\nthis, is it not?\\n    Dr. Guidice. Right, and new stewards need some humility to \\nrealize that these things are not as simple as running a \\ncomputer code.\\n    By the way, that is not to demean the current generation of \\nstewards. The ones that I have talked to I think do have a \\nsense of awe about what they are being asked to do, but we need \\nto let them do more while the older, experienced people are \\naround.\\n    Senator Allard. Yes. You mentioned a report in section F, \\nunder NNSA management, on page 24, that unfunded mandates to \\nmeet functional requirements undermine the program budget, \\nplans, and milestones, and I guess the question is, do these \\nmandates come from Congress, or do they come from DOE, or both?\\n    Mr. Guidice. The kinds of unfunded mandates we are talking \\nabout are generally in safety and security, OK. Security is \\nrelatively new, this last round of security. We had a round in \\nthe 1980's as well, but it reaches its height in safety, where \\napproaches to safety are not coordinated with program \\nrequirements, in other words, the work that is actually \\nnecessary to do to maintain the stockpile.\\n    We are hopeful that a true or good planning and budgeting \\nprocess would help decide how much to pay on what are now \\nunfunded mandates, but what we do not see is a process for \\njudging how much is enough. It is very difficult for people and \\nfor organizations to decide how much safety is enough, are you \\nway out on the diminishing returns part of the curve for your \\ninvestment, and what we do not see is the process to put that \\nin balance.\\n    Now, I hope the multiyear budget process----\\n    Senator Allard. It is very difficult to measure.\\n    Mr. Guidice. Yes.\\n    Senator Allard. Could you give me some examples of funded \\nmandates which you believe are not critical to the core mission \\nat NNSA or the labs?\\n    Mr. Guidice. Well, I do not want to give you a specific \\nexample, but I would stick on the issue of safety. A number of \\nthings that we do in safety are way out on the diminishing \\nreturns part of the curve. They go beyond the laws and \\nregulations. They go to interpretation and increasingly \\nrestrictive interpretation. We go through waves of this, and \\ninitially what happens--in fact, there is a wave going on with \\nsecurity right now. The requirements are extremely stringent, \\npeople realize they cannot afford them and pay for them, and \\neventually reason settles in, but only after a long period of \\ntime and a lot of money to get there.\\n    I see that mostly in safety. We do things in the name of \\nsafety that do not really add a lot to safety in terms of \\nvalue-added to the worker and health.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. In cases the redesign of a nuclear weapon \\nhas diminished the reliability of that weapon because of the \\naddition of the safety features that might malfunction.\\n    Senator Allard. I see. Now, in dealing with the question of \\ncooperation between DOD and DOE, to what extent has mitigation \\nof authority and the temporary vacancy of the assistant \\nSecretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological \\nDefense Programs negatively affected the relationship between \\nDOD and DOE, if at all?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Well, I think the answer to that, Mr. \\nChairman, is that without the critical personnel in the \\nDepartment of Defense in particular, the Nuclear Weapons \\nCouncil, which is supposed to be the bridge between the two \\nagencies, becomes less functional, less attentive to problems, \\nand therefore it is important either to have that assistant \\nSecretary in place, or alternatively to charge somebody else in \\nthe Pentagon with the responsibility to keep the Nuclear \\nWeapons Council functioning.\\n    Senator Allard. Then, just to conclude here, I would just \\nsay--unless, Senator Dayton, you have any more questions, if \\nanyone needs testimony or copies of the slides you can come to \\nthe committee and we will have them ready for you, and we will \\nleave the record open for 2 days for questions, and thank you, \\nDr. Schlesinger and Mr. Guidice.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The pictures over there of the various \\ncrumbling facilities also are available for the record.\\n    Senator Allard. They will be made available. Thank you very \\nmuch.\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Thank you, sir.\\n    Mr. Guidice. Thank you.\\n    Senator Allard. The subcommittee is adjourned.\\n    [Questions for the record with answers supplied follow:]\\n\\n                Questions Submitted by Senator Bob Smith\\n\\n    Senator Smith. I note that like the DOE, the DOD has serious \\nproblems sustaining its unique nuclear capabilities. Deterioration in \\nfacilities, loss of experienced senior scientific and engineering \\nstaff, the inability to attract a younger generation, and low morale \\nall apply.\\n    What actions might the Panel take during the third year of study to \\ndevelop recommendations for coordination between DOE and DOD that \\nretain and reconstitute the complementary capabilities of each \\norganization?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. For the first few years following in the Cold War, \\nthe Department of Defense gave, appropriately in my view, less emphasis \\nto the nuclear deterrent. The Panel's concern is that DOD has gone too \\nfar in this regard and that the DOD portion of the nuclear deterrence \\nmission has suffered as a result.\\n    Over the coming year, the Panel will be developing proposed \\nconfidence indicators--measures that Congress might use to appraise the \\nsuccess or failure of stockpile stewardship. This will include measures \\ninvolving the DOD nuclear mission and the Defense Department's \\ncollaborations with NNSA/DOE. For this purpose, we will be looking at \\nthe following:\\n\\n         Do DOD strategy reviews and the revised Nuclear \\n        Posture Review result in a DOD nuclear deterrence mission that \\n        is clearly defined, effectively communicated as a national- and \\n        departmental-priority, and adequately resourced?\\n         Does the DOD Nuclear Mission Management Plan provide a \\n        genuine plan for all aspects of the DOD nuclear mission, to \\n        include specific, measurable objectives; milestones for \\n        accomplishments; and resources? Is the DOD plan congruent with \\n        the NNSA/DOE Stockpile Stewardship Plan? Has DOD defined \\n        specific requirements for the technical capabilities it needs \\n        from NNSA, both to meet currently forecast needs associated \\n        with the enduring stockpile and current delivery systems, and \\n        to meet new requirements if and as the threats to be countered \\n        change in the future?\\n         Is the Nuclear Weapons Council functioning effectively \\n        as the critical interface between DOD and NNSA/DOE? In this \\n        regard, the Panel is encouraged that the NWC has resumed having \\n        regular meetings and that at the end of last year it reached \\n        initial agreement concerning Life Extension Programs (LEP) for \\n        the B61, W80, and W76 weapons. The Panel will be monitoring \\n        actions to define and accomplish these programs, plus the \\n        status of, and lessons learned from, the W87 LEP that has been \\n        underway (and behind schedule) for some time.\\n         Is the Department of Defense providing appropriate \\n        senior-level leadership and oversight for DOD nuclear matters? \\n        In this regard, our second report recommended that DOD return \\n        to the past practice of having an official appointed by the \\n        President and confirmed by the Senate serve as Assistant to the \\n        Secretary for nuclear matters.\\n\\n    As part of our appraisal in this area, the Panel will also be \\nexamining the Defense Department's response to a recommendation posed \\nin 1990 by the Congressionally chartered Nuclear Weapons Safety Panel \\nthat this Assistant to the Secretary of Defense be given a more senior \\nstatus as the OSD member of the Nuclear Weapons Council and upgraded to \\nthe same status as an Assistant Secretary of Defense, with direct line \\nof reporting to the Secretary of Defense.\\\\1\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Nuclear Weapon Safety. Report of the Panel on Nuclear Weapons \\nSafety of the Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives. \\nCommittee Print 15. December, 1990, p. 20.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    The Panel will also give attention to the programs of the Defense \\nThreat Reduction Agency (DTRA), the successor to the Defense Nuclear \\nAgency. In the Panel's initial look at the DTRA program, the downward \\ntrend in funding for nuclear weapons effects research and readiness is \\nof concern. Specific issues to be reviewed include integration of DOD \\nand DOE programs for nuclear weapon effects modeling, simulation, and \\nsimulator technology development; the DOD nuclear weapons effects \\nphenomenology technical base; and readiness for nuclear tests. In the \\ncurrent year, the Panel has already reviewed DTRA test readiness \\nactivities. Our assessment is that DOD does not have a test readiness \\nplan and resourced program.\\n                                 ______\\n                                 \\n                Questions Submitted by Senator Jack Reed\\n\\n    Senator Reed. Dr. Schlesinger, why is funding for the Laboratory \\nDirected Research and Development program important to the overall \\nhealth of the laboratories?\\n    Is this funding equally valuable for the weapons program?\\n    Do you agree with the recommendation of the Secretary of Energy's \\nAdvisory Board Report that LDRD program funding should be increased?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Laboratory Directed Research and Development \\n(LDRD) is a very important component of the programs within the three \\nnuclear weapon laboratories--Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and \\nSandia. It provides laboratory directors with some flexible resources \\nneeded to sustain world-class scientific programs. It enables the \\nlaboratories to initiate development of the next generation of \\ntechnologies in a timely way. LDRD funds are crucial for recruiting the \\nbest and the brightest of the new scientists for whom the labs are \\nalways searching.\\n    Past LDRD funding supported development of some of the key \\ntechnologies being utilized in the Stockpile Stewardship Program.\\\\1\\\\ \\nExamples include radiation hardened microelectronics at Sandia, proton \\nradiography at Los Alamos, and use of laser heated diamond anvil cells \\nto develop new information concerning plutonium equations of state at \\nLawrence Livermore.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ This and the examples below are based on the information \\nprovided in: Review of the Department of Energy's Laboratory Directed \\nResearch and Development Program. Department of Energy, External \\nMembers of the Laboratory Operations Board.

This \\nis particularly important as we implement the science-based stockpile \\nstewardship program.\\n    Particularly at the physics labs (Lawrence Livermore and Los \\nAlamos), LDRD plays an important role in funding postdoctoral \\nresearchers, many of whom are involved in, or transition to, research \\nin direct support of the weapons program.\\n    The specific Secretary of Energy Advisory Report recommendation \\nbeing referenced is:\\n\\n        The Congress should restore the LDRD program at the DOE multi-\\n        program laboratories to at least 6 percent, and should restore \\n        Environmental Management programs to the LDRD base.\\\\2\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Review of the Department of Energy's Laboratory Directed \\nResearch and Development Program.

Dr. Schlesinger, you indicated in your testimony that \\nthe laboratories have been hurt in their ability to attract new \\nscientists and engineers as a result of the increased emphasis on \\nsecurity.\\n    Do you have any specific recommendations on how to improve the \\nimage of labs and their ability to recruit?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. There is a strong commitment to security within \\nthe laboratories, plants, and NNSA. Current issues involve the manner \\nin which responses to recent security incidents have been accomplished. \\nOur Panel endorses the analysis and recommendations of the security \\nreview accomplished by Senator Baker and Representative Hamilton. With \\nregard to the situation within Los Alamos National Laboratory, it was \\ntheir finding that:\\n\\n          . . . the combined effects of the Wen Ho Lee affair, the \\n        recent fire at LANL, and the continuing swirl around the hard-\\n        drive episode have devastated morale and productivity at LANL. \\n        The employees we met expressed fear and deep concern over the \\n        influx of FBI agents and yellow crime-scene tape in their \\n        workspace, the interrogation of their colleagues by the FBI and \\n        by Federal prosecutors before a grand jury, and the resort of \\n        some of their colleagues to taking a second mortgage on their \\n        homes to pay for attorney fees. The inevitable anxiety \\n        resulting from these circumstances collectively has, by all \\n        accounts, had a highly negative effect on the ability of LANL \\n        and the other national laboratories to continue to do their \\n        work, while attracting and maintaining the talented personnel \\n        who are the lifeblood of the cutting-edge work of the \\n        laboratory. This is particularly true in X Division and NEST, \\n        but seems to be a factor in the lab as a whole.\\\\5\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\5\\\\ Science and Security in the Service of the Nation: a review of \\nthe security incident involving classified hard drives at Los Alamos \\nNational Laboratory. A report to the President of the United States and \\nthe Secretary of Energy by the Honorable Howard H. Baker, Jr. and the \\nHonorable Lee H. Hamilton, September 2000, p. 23.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n          The ability of LANL and the other national laboratories to \\n        attract and retain top talent has already been eroded, and now \\n        stands at serious risk. If the National laboratories lose the \\n        ability to attract and retain top talent, then U.S. national \\n        security will be seriously harmed. That harm may be long \\n        lasting, in light of the specialized nature of nuclear weapon \\n        design technology and the inexorable attrition through \\n        retirement and other departures of the dwindling numbers who \\n        understand them thoroughly.\\n          It is doubtful that the DOE, NNSA, LANL, and the University \\n        of California will be able effectively to redress either \\n        security or management lapses in the midst of a continuing \\n        criminal investigation or prosecution. It is critically \\n        important to national security that the internal disruptions at \\n        LANL be brought to a swift and orderly conclusion, and that the \\n        new management structure of the NNSA take all necessary \\n        measures to put the laboratory back to work, and to establish \\n        the conditions that will be conducive over the long term to the \\n        development of leading-edge science in a safe and secure \\n        environment.\\\\6\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\6\\\\ Science and Security in the Service of the Nation: a review of \\nthe security incident involving classified hard drives at Los Alamos \\nNational Laboratory.

September 2000. p. 23.\\n\\n    Our Panel believes that Baker and Hamilton identify key actions \\nthat are needed to achieve a long-term solution that provides for both \\nworld-class science and effective security. Two of their \\nrecommendations warrant particular emphasis.

These are some of the most intelligent \\npeople in the Nation. We need to involve them to a much greater extent \\nin developing measures that provide effective protection for critical \\ninformation and materials while at the same time reducing \\nadministrative burdens that do not make substantial contributions to \\nour objectives.

This will make a significant contribution to the ability \\nof the labs and plants to recruit the top-quality staffs that are \\nneeded.\\n    Our Panel's agenda for the coming year includes development of \\nproposed measures indexing the extent to which we can have warranted \\nconfidence in our stockpile, and the technical and production \\ninfrastructure that supports it. This will include measures dealing \\nwith the weapon labs and plants. These indicators will involve \\nconfidence in the people who do stewardship, in the processes employed, \\nand the adequacy of the criteria for the tools necessary to judge \\nwhether the stockpile can be certified.\\n    Several years ago the Chiles Commission conducted a very insightful \\nsurvey within the weapons complex.\\\\9\\\\ It asked some very important \\nquestions, for example: ``Would you recommend your laboratory, \\nfacility, or test site as a good place to work?''. Responses were 75 \\npercent, yes; 25 percent, no.

Dr. Schlesinger, you suggested a possible need to \\ndesign a robust warhead design.\\n    Is this suggestion made to ensure maintenance of technical skills \\nto design a new warhead, or is this recommendation made to support \\nactual development, certification and deployment of a new warhead?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. Several points warrant attention in addressing the \\ndesign of robust, alternative warheads. A starting point involves \\npolicy considerations as articulated in statements made by the previous \\nadministration that I hope will be endorsed by its successor. The first \\nof these is that having the ability to design and field new weapon \\ntypes is an integral part of the stockpile stewardship program.\\\\10\\\\ \\nSecond, nothing in the proposed CTBT to which the Senate did not give \\nadvice and consent would inhibit the design, development, or production \\nof nuclear weapons.\\\\11\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\10\\\\ ``. . .

Instead, we asked them to design \\nweapons that are safe and are highly optimized for weight, yield, and \\nmaterial usage. The result is that some current stockpile weapon \\ndesigns have thin performance margins. These designs are fussy, and \\npast testing has revealed inconsistencies that are not understood.\\n    Every part within our enduring stockpile weapons is a limited life \\ncomponent; every one of these parts will at some point be replaced.\\\\12\\\\ \\nSome of the original parts will no longer be available; some \\nmanufacturing processes cannot be reproduced.

Chiles, Jr. Before the U.S. Senate Armed \\nServices Committee, October 7, 1999.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    The Panel recommends design of more robust, alternative warheads \\nbased on successfully tested designs for both of the reasons stated in \\nthe question. The objective is to design, develop, and certify robust, \\nalternative warheads that would provide hedges against future \\nuncertainties. We believe that there may come a time 10 or 20 years \\nfrom now at which we may have more confidence in alternative weapons \\nbased on more conservative versions of previously tested designs than \\nwe would have in the inevitably modified versions of enduring stockpile \\nweapons.\\n    In this proposal risk would be reduced by making use of \\nconservative versions of designs that have been previously tested. \\nThere are, however, limits to our confidence in past experience and our \\ncalculations. If a decision is made to introduce a new robust warhead \\ninto the active stockpile, decisions would have to be made concerning \\npotential testing requirements.\\n    The Panel also recommends doing this in order to ensure maintenance \\nof the technical skills needed for design of new warheads. Perhaps the \\ngreatest of our challenges is human capital. We need to train a new \\ngeneration of stewards for the nuclear stockpile. This is most \\neffectively done by having them work now on design of real weapons \\nunder the tutelage of experienced designers.\\n    Senator Reed. Dr. Schlesinger, you and Mr. Guidice discussed that \\nthe weapons programs are burdened by unfunded mandates for health and \\nsafety.\\n    Can you provide some specific examples of specific unfunded \\nmandates and can you identify the source of those mandates?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The most problematic unfunded mandates involve \\ndirection to the laboratories and plants that must be implemented \\nimmediately or in a very brief period of time. Such direction involves \\nactions that were not anticipated when program plans were developed and \\napproved and hence can only be implemented by taking resources away \\nfrom other weapons program activities and resources. In other cases \\nthese mandates involve costs that could be anticipated, but DOE has \\nelected not to program the needed resources. Over the past decade, \\nunfunded mandates have typically involved matters having to do with \\nenvironment, safety, and health (ES&H) and security matters.\\n    In every case the organization with primary responsibility for such \\ndirection is the Department of Energy.\\n    In some instances mandates involving ES&H result from \\nrecommendations made by the Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board \\n(DNFSB). For example, there are 29 actions responding to DNFSB \\nrecommendations scheduled for implementation in 2000-2002. However, it \\nremains the responsibility of the Department of Energy to manage \\nimplementation of such actions in a manner that is responsive to both \\nthe DNFSB's recommendations and the National objectives being \\naccomplished in the weapons program.\\n    In a recent review, the National Nuclear Security Administration \\nhas succinctly summarized the impact that unfunded mandates have on \\ncritical stockpile surveillance tasks:\\n\\n        Efficiency of conducting surveillance cycles and the timeliness \\n        of surveillance data have been adversely affected at the plants \\n        by frequent and unexpected changes in security and safety \\n        requirements, facility availability, and safety authorization \\n        basis changes or expirations. Programmatic needs and schedules \\n        should be considered before implementing changes to facilities, \\n        processes, or safety authorization basis requirements. Of \\n        course, critical safety issues are paramount and must be \\n        addressed as quickly as possible.\\\\13\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\13\\\\ Strategic Review of the Surveillance Program: 150-Day Report. \\nNational Nuclear Security Administration, Defense Programs. January 1, \\n2001.\\n\\n    Many of the recent unfunded mandates involve security. Over the \\npast 24 months, DOE has promulgated more than 40 new Orders, Notices, \\nand other directives. Once issued, contractors are audited to these new \\nstandards.\\n    An example of an unfunded mandate involving security is the \\nSecretary of Energy's 9 Point Cyber Security Initiatives and the Six \\nFurther Enhancements. These were required to be implemented on short \\ntimelines, with no immediate funding for this purpose. In the case of \\nLos Alamos National Laboratory, implementation of this new direction \\nentailed a cost of approximately $15M in fiscal year 2001. At Pantex \\nPlant, the estimated cost was $31.5M. Some of the new standards had to \\nbe implemented within 14 days of promulgation. Subsequent to the \\nissuance of this guidance, DOE made provision for additional funding \\nfor these activities; however, when initially implemented, \\nreprogramming of resources within the plants and labs was required.\\n    Another example that had complex-wide impact was DOE direction in \\nJune, 2000 requiring changes in long-standing security practices. For \\nexample, some computer media had to be encrypted and all vaults for \\nstorage of classified materials continuously staffed and when not \\nstaffed, locked and alarmed. The time frame for implementation varied \\nfrom immediately to 30 days.\\n    The age of many facilities within the complex impacts \\nimplementation of a DOE directive to provide for Nationally Recognized \\nTesting Laboratory or Equivalent certification for electrical \\nequipment. The estimated cost for only the high voltage system at \\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory is $34M. Los Alamos National \\nLaboratory's current estimate for related expenses is approximately \\n$50M.\\n    Many additional examples could be provided. Viewed individually, \\nany specific unfunded mandate may not appear significant. To understand \\nthe impact that these unfunded mandates have on the complex's ability \\nto accomplish the Stockpile Stewardship Program, it is necessary that \\nattention be given to their substance, to the circumstances within \\nwhich they are being implemented, and to the processes employed by the \\nDepartment of Energy in managing their promulgation and implementation.\\n    With respect to the substance of the direction provided in these \\nmandates, there are instances in which new direction is warranted. Our \\nunderstanding of safety, security, and ES&H matters continues to \\ndevelop, due in large part to a vigorous research program that improves \\nour understanding of potential issues. It is the objective of our \\nnational counterintelligence activities to improve our understanding of \\nboth potential security threats and appropriate countermeasures. As new \\ntechnologies are deployed as integral parts of the weapons program, new \\nmeasures are needed, e.g., in cyber security. Standards and \\nexpectations for ES&H and other matters have changed significantly in \\nthe many decades since some of the current facilities were constructed. \\nThere are, however, some situations in which required and implemented \\nmandates did not add to safety or security. For such cases, it is \\nimportant to improve the process in a manner that allows all \\nstakeholders to participate in the appraisal of costs and benefits.\\n    There is a legitimate requirement for the Department of Energy, as \\nthe governmental agency responsible for all aspects of the weapons \\nprogram, to provide top-down direction for these matters. Practices \\nneed to be state-of-the-art and consistent throughout the complex. It \\nis also appropriate for DOE to establish milestones for implementation \\nof measures to enhance safety, security, and ES&H. A past problem \\nwithin the complex was that such issues could be identified without \\nprompt action being taken to redress them.\\\\14\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\14\\\\ In one past situation, a number of years transpired before \\naction was taken to respond to a safety-related issues. Nuclear Weapon \\nSafety. Report of the Panel on Nuclear Weapons Safety of the Committee \\non Armed Services, House of Representatives. Committee Print 15. \\nDecember, 1990. p. 26.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Furthermore, it is important to recognize that there can be \\nexceptional situations, particularly those involving potential safety \\nhazards, in which immediate implementation of guidance is imperative.\\n    Circumstances can make it very difficult to implement unfunded \\nmandates. Key issues were identified by the Department of Energy in its \\n30-Day Review:\\n\\n        Additional pressures such as increased security requirements, \\n        newly discovered stockpile issues, and resource limitations \\n        have collectively forced the program, overall, to be ``wound \\n        too tight'' with too little program flexibility or \\n        contingencies. This is evident from the fact that the Campaign \\n        and Directed Stockpile Work is so tightly intertwined that \\n        adjustments to specific program milestones or budgets may \\n        result in significant regrets for the SSP as a whole. . .\\\\15\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\15\\\\ Stockpile Stewardship Program: 30-Day Review. U.S. Department \\nof Energy. November 23, 1999. p. 7-6.\\n\\n    Viewed in isolation, many of the unfunded mandate issues that might \\nbe identified by the laboratories and plants do not appear impressive. \\nWhy should it matter if 10 staff members were diverted to a new task \\nfor a number of months? The problem is that in a program that is \\n``wound too tight'' the few people capable of performing a technical \\ntask are diverted in a manner that requires important weapons program \\nwork to halt, or be significantly delayed, until they are released. A \\nsimilar point holds for management resources within the complex. A new \\ntask that might be readily managed using standard processes and \\ntimelines may, if immediate implementation is directed, take a number \\nof key managers off-line for a period of time in a manner that has a \\nnegative impact on multiple activities that can no longer receive \\nneeded attention. Furthermore, much of the problem is due to the \\naggregate demands posed by the large number of unfunded mandates as \\nopposed to mandate-specific burdens.\\n    Another important circumstance involves the age and deterioration \\nof key facilities. We are attempting to apply modern standards in \\nfacilities that were designed to meet very different criteria. In many \\ninstances implementation is very difficult. Furthermore, aging and \\nuncorrected deterioration make it more likely that issues requiring \\naction are likely to develop.\\n    The processes by which direction is provided by DOE to the \\nlaboratories and plants exacerbate the problems. A important issue is \\nthat there have been too many personnel and organizations within DOE \\nand NNSA capable of issuing guidance directly to organizations within \\nthe complex, bypassing line management.\\\\16\\\\ When this happens, \\nauthority and responsibility are no longer aligned. Congress has taken \\naction to solve these problems through establishment of NNSA, and by \\nrequiring NNSA to develop an appropriate staffing and organization plan \\nto identify roles and responsibilities of headquarters and field \\norganizations; appropriate modifications, downsizing, eliminations, or \\nconsolidations of organization units; and modifications to headquarters \\nand field organization staffing levels.\\\\17\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\16\\\\ The problem that there are too many people within Defense \\nPrograms and measures that might be taken to simplify DOE management of \\nthe weapons program are addressed in The Organization and Management of \\nthe Nuclear Weapons Program.

Spence National Defense Authorization \\nAct for Fiscal Year 2001, Section 3153.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    In its recent report, our Panel recommended additional actions to \\nimprove NNSA management that would, among other objectives, alleviate \\nsome of the burdens associated with unfunded mandates. Specifically, \\nDOE needs to focus responsibility and authority in its line management; \\nall DOE functional interactions with the weapons complex should flow \\nthrough NNSA; and roles, responsibilities, and line management \\nstructures within NNSA should be aligned with the structure of the NNSA \\nprogram.\\\\18\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\18\\\\ Fiscal Year 2000 Report to Congress, Panel to Assess the \\nReliability, Safety, and Security of the United States Nuclear \\nStockpile, February 1, 2001. pp. 24-25.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    A second set of process issues involves the manner in which \\ndirection is developed and communicated. A significant part of the \\nproblem is that direction with a major impact on accomplishment of the \\nweapons program can arrive at the labs and plants with little or no \\nadvance notice. Modern management practices that make use of integrated \\nprocess team (IPT) and related methods could substantially alleviate \\nthis problem. This would involve a team approach in which participants \\nfrom the labs and plants would work with NNSA to give consideration to \\nnew direction before it is issued. This is not to say that the labs and \\nplants should have a veto; the objective, rather, is to involve all \\nstakeholders in a manner that crafts appropriately focused guidance \\nthat can be implemented in a manner that minimizes negative impacts on \\nother aspects of the weapons programs. In a an extreme situation such \\nadvance consultation may not be possible, e.g., if a serious safety-\\nrelated issue is identified. In most circumstances, however, the Panel \\nbelieves that such advance consultation would be practical and, given \\nexperience with IPTs within the Department of Defense, beneficial.\\n    As part of this increased collaboration, the Panel believes that \\nactions need to be taken to reduce the amount of time that technical \\nstaffs within the complex spend on administrative actions that respond \\nto DOE taskings. The Panel recommends that DOE and NNSA give immediate \\npriority to elimination of two-thirds of these burdens.\\\\19\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\19\\\\ Fiscal year 2000 Report to Congress, Panel to Assess the \\nReliability, Safety, and Security of the United States Nuclear \\nStockpile, February 1, 2001. p. 25.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    The Panel also recommends that NNSA, with significant participation \\nfrom the labs and plants, address some of the strategic issues \\nunderlying specific direction for matters involving security, safety, \\nand ES&H. A basic issue is: What are the standards? There is nothing \\nthat cannot be made safer or more secure. There appear to be situations \\nin which the criteria being imposed exceed or do not clearly correspond \\nto law or regulation. This may, in specific situations, be appropriate. \\nHowever, this needs to be established in a more systematic way. This \\nwould allow resources to be more optimally invested in a balanced \\nmanner, complex-wide. It would also allow potential interactions \\nbetween standards to be identified and managed; measures to enhance \\nsafety may or may not contribute to improved security.Furthermore, \\nthere appear to be situations in which, over time, there is \\nrequirements creep that adds to burdens without improving safety and \\nsecurity.\\n    Resources are needed for implementation of new direction. Here the \\nfundamental problem is a weapons program that is ``wound too tight.'' \\nThe Panel believes that the Department of Energy's appraisal is on the \\nmark:\\n\\n        . . . Flexibility and contingency is needed in both the science \\n        and engineering programs and the production facilities to \\n        address these issues. Indicators of stress include lower morale \\n        in parts of the work force and increased difficulty in \\n        recruitment of top scientists and engineers.\\\\20\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\20\\\\ Stockpile Stewardship Program. 30-Day Review. U.S. Department \\nof Energy. November 23, 1999. p. 7-6.\\n\\n    NNSA/DOE needs to program funding to meet security and ES&H needs. \\nGiven recent experience with such mandates , it should be possible to \\nestimate the magnitude of the investment that may be needed.\\n    Senator Reed. Dr. Schlesinger, you mentioned that a weapon has been \\nredesigned to address a safety issue and as a result the reliability of \\nthe weapon has been reduced.\\n    Can you please provide some additional detail on this including \\nwhich weapon, when was the modification made, why was the modification \\nmade and what was the specific requirement that drove the modification?\\n    Dr. Schlesinger. The point made during testimony applies to \\nmultiple weapons in the enduring stockpile. The reliability estimates \\nfor each of these weapons is classified; however, NNSA does publish \\nsemi-annual classified reports which you might request.\\n    A starting point for considering potential interactions between \\nweapon safety features and weapon reliability is provided in the report \\nof the Congressionally-chartered Nuclear Weapons Safety panel, which \\nprovides an unclassified overview of the modern approach to enhance the \\nelectrical safety of a nuclear weapon against premature detonation. All \\nof the weapons in the enduring stockpile, except the older W62 which we \\nexpect to be retired, were designed to incorporate what is called \\n``enhanced nuclear detonation safety'' (ENDS). The ENDS concept was \\ndeveloped to improve the predictable safe response of our weapons in \\naccident environments, such as a fire. ENDS introduces three links (two \\nstrong and one weak) in an exclusion region within the weapon. For the \\nweapon to arm, both strong links have to be closed electrically, one by \\nspecific operator coded information input, the other by environmental \\ninput corresponding to a trajectory or spin motion appropriate to the \\nweapon's flight profile. The weak link is designed to open (or break) \\nand thereby prevent arming if there is a temperature excursion beyond \\nset bounds, as might be caused by a fire during an accident.\\\\21\\\\ Design \\nor redesign of a weapon to incorporate ENDS necessarily adds components \\nto the device. Each component that is added to a weapon is another part \\nthat might fail, impacting reliability.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\21\\\\ Nuclear Weapon Safety. Report of the Panel on Nuclear Weapons \\nSafety of the Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives. \\nCommittee Print 15. December, 1990. p. 13.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    The same point holds for use control or other features that might \\nbe added to a weapon. Particularly if these features are integral to \\nthe performance of the weapon, they involve additional parts that might \\nfail and, more generally, add to the complexity of the device, and \\ncomplexity can be the enemy of reliability. Furthermore, such safety \\nand control features, like every other part of a nuclear weapon, must \\nbe regarded as limited life components that will at some point be \\nreplaced.\\\\22\\\\ Again, this adds a source a complexity with attendant \\nimplications for reliability.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\22\\\\ Statement by Henry G. Chiles, Jr. Before the U.S. Senate Armed \\nServices Committee, October 7, 1999.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    In regard to plans for Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for our \\nenduring stockpile weapons, over the coming year the Panel will again \\nbe looking at how well we accomplish safety and security in the design \\nof our weapons. We need to make sure that the weapon safety and \\nsecurity improvements that are implemented do not unduly reduce our \\nconfidence in the reliability of our weapons. This is especially true \\nif these improvements are designed into the nuclear package of the \\nweapon, which cannot be tested under the current nuclear test \\nmoratorium.\\n    On this subject, an observation made in the Panel's recent report \\nalso merits attention: The Panel is concerned that some current \\nenduring stockpile weapon designs are so highly optimized for weight, \\nyield, and material usage that they provide very thin performance \\nmargins. These designs are fussy, and testing has revealed \\ninconsistencies that are not understood.\\\\23\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\23\\\\ Fiscal Year 2000 Report to Congress, Panel to Assess the \\nReliability, Safety, and Security of the United States Nuclear \\nStockpile, February 1, 2001. p. 13.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    For the enduring stockpile weapons with these characteristics, the \\ncomplexity (and hence potential performance risk) added by safety and \\nuse control devices is done on top of very thin performance margins. \\nThe enduring stockpile weapons were never designed on the assumption \\nthat they would be retained beyond their originally intended service \\nlives. Under these circumstances, the Panel recommends that, as a \\nmatter of prudence, work also be undertaken on the design of robust, \\nalternative weapons that will provide a hedge.\\n    Looking to potential safety/reliability interactions in the future, \\na final point warrants note. The Congressionally chartered Nuclear \\nSafety Panel was established in response to issues that had been \\nidentified in the stockpile of that time. Some of these issues were \\ndeveloped because of advances in modeling. With the advent of the first \\nthree-dimensional codes, it was possible to determine that some \\nprevious assumptions made concerning the weapons were incorrect. As the \\nStockpile Stewardship Program advances our understanding of the \\nenduring stockpile weapons, it is reasonable to expect that we may \\nuncover additional issues. In 1990, it was still possible to make \\nsignificant changes to weapon designs and then test them to ensure that \\nmodifications did not impair reliability. For a modification that \\nimpacts the nuclear package of the weapon, that option is no longer \\navailable.\\n\\n    [Whereupon, at 4:20 p.m., the subcommittee adjourned.]\\n\\n                                 \\n\\n\\n\""
