Richard Burr \\n(Chairman of the Committee) presiding.\\n    Committee Members Present: Senators Burr, Warner, Risch, \\nRubio, Collins, Blunt, Lankford, Cotton, Cornyn, Feinstein, \\nWyden, Heinrich, King, Manchin, and Harris.\\n\\n   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BURR, CHAIRMAN, A U.S. \\n                  SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA\\n\\n    Chairman Burr. I'd like to call this hearing to order. I \\napologize to our witnesses that we had a vote that was called \\nat 10:00 and most members are in the process of making their \\nway from there to here.\\n    This morning the committee will engage in an activity \\nthat's quite rare for us, an open hearing on an ongoing \\ncritical intelligence question: the role of Russian active \\nmeasures past and present. As many of you know, this committee \\nis conducting a thorough, independent, and nonpartisan review \\nof the Russian active measures campaign conducted against the \\n2016 U.S. elections.\\n    Some of the intelligence provided to the committee is \\nextremely sensitive, which requires that most of the work be \\nconducted in a secure setting to maintain the integrity of the \\ninformation and to protect the very sensitive sources and \\nmethods that gave us access to that intelligence. However, the \\nVice Chairman and I understand the gravity of the issues that \\nwe're here reviewing and have decided that it's crucial that we \\ntake the rare step of discussing publicly an ongoing \\nintelligence question.\\n    That's why we've convened this second open hearing on the \\ntopic of Russian active measures, and I can assure you to the \\nextent possible the committee will hold additional open \\nhearings on this issue.\\n    The American public, indeed all democratic societies, need \\nto understand that malign actors are using old techniques with \\nnew platforms to undermine our democratic institutions.\\n    This hearing, entitled ``Disinformation: A Primer in \\nRussian Active Measures and Influence Campaigns,'' will consist \\nof two panels and will provide a foundational understanding of \\nRussian active measures and information operations campaigns. \\nThe first panel will examine the history and characteristics of \\nthose campaigns. The second panel will examine the history and \\ncharacteristics of those campaigns and the role and \\ncapabilities of cyber operations in support of these \\nactivities.\\n    Unfortunately, you will learn today that these efforts by \\nRussia to discredit the U.S. and weaken the West are not new. \\nThese efforts are in fact a part of Russian, and previous \\nSoviet Union, intelligence efforts. You will learn today that \\nour community has been a target of Russian information warfare, \\npropaganda, and cyber campaigns and still is.\\n    The efforts our experts will outline today continue \\nunabated. The takeaway from today's hearing: We're all targets \\nof a sophisticated and capable adversary and we must engage in \\na whole-of-government approach to combat Russian active \\nmeasures.\\n    Today we'll receive testimony from experts who have in some \\ncases worked directly to respond to active measures, who \\nunderstand the history and the context of active measures, and \\nwhose significant experience and knowledge will shed new light \\non the problem and provide useful context. Doctors Godson and \\nRumer, Mr. Watts, we're grateful to you for your appearance \\nhere today.\\n    This afternoon we will reconvene and welcome witnesses who \\nwill discuss the technical side of the question, cyber \\noperations, including computer network exploitation, social \\nmedia, and online propaganda activities, and how they enable \\nand promote Russian influence campaigns and information \\noperations.\\n    We have a full day ahead of us and I'm confident that the \\ntestimony you will hear today will help you to establish a \\nfoundational understanding of the problem as the committee \\ncontinues its inquiry into Russian activities.\\n    Finally, I'd like to commend the Vice Chairman for his \\ndedication to the goals of the committee's inquiry and to the \\nintegrity of the process. The Vice Chairman and I realize that \\nif we politicize this process our efforts will likely fail. The \\npublic deserves to hear the truth about possible Russian \\ninvolvement in our elections, how they came to be involved, how \\nwe may have failed to prevent that involvement, what actions \\nwere taken in response, if any, and what we plan to do to \\nensure the integrity of future free elections at the heart of \\nour democracy.\\n    Gentlemen, thank you again for your willingness to be here, \\nand I turn to the Vice Chairman.\\n\\nOPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARK R. WARNER, VICE CHAIRMAN, A U.S. \\n                     SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA\\n\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also want \\nto welcome our witnesses today.\\n    Today's hearing is important to help understand the role \\nRussia played in the 2016 presidential elections. As the U.S. \\nintelligence community unanimously assessed in January of this \\nyear, Russia sought to hijack our democratic process, and that \\nmost important part of our democratic process, our presidential \\nelections.\\n    As we'll learn today, Russia's strategy and tactics are not \\nnew, but their brazenness certainly was. The hearing is also \\nimportant because it's open, as the Chairman mentioned, which \\nis sometimes unusual for this committee. Due to the classified \\nnature of our work, we typically work behind closed doors.\\n    Today's public hearing will help, I hope, the American \\npublic writ large understand how the Kremlin made effective use \\nof its hacking skills to steal and weaponize information and \\nengage in a coordinated effort to damage a particular candidate \\nand to undermine public confidence in our democratic process.\\n    Our witnesses today will help us to understand how Russia \\ndeployed this deluge of disinformation in a broader attempt to \\nundermine America's strength and leadership throughout the \\nworld.\\n    We simply must and we will get this right. The Chairman and \\nI agree it is vitally important that we do this in as credible, \\nbipartisan, and transparent manner as possible. As we said \\nyesterday at our press conference, Chairman Burr and I trust \\neach other and, equally important, we trust our colleagues on \\nthis committee, that we are going to move together and we're \\ngoing to get to the bottom of this and do it right.\\n    As this hearing begins, let's take just one moment to \\nreview what we already know. Russia's President, Vladimir \\nPutin, ordered a deliberate campaign carefully constructed to \\nundermine our election. First Russia struck at our political \\ninstitutions by electronically breaking into the headquarters \\nof one of our political parties and stealing vast amounts of \\ninformation. Russian operatives also hacked emails to steal \\npersonal messages and other information from individuals \\nranging from Clinton Campaign Manager John Podesta to former \\nSecretary of State Colin Powell.\\n    This stolen information was then weaponized. We know that \\nRussian intelligence used the quote-unquote Guccifer 2 persona \\nand others like WikiLeaks at seemingly choreographed times that \\nwould cause maximum damage to one candidate.\\n    They did this with an unprecedented level of sophistication \\nabout American presidential politics that should be a line of \\ninquiry for us on this committee and, candidly, while it helped \\none candidate this time, they are not favoring one party over \\nanother and consequently it should be a concern for all of us.\\n    Second, Russia continually sought to diminish and undermine \\nour trust in the American media by blurring our faith in what \\nis true and what is not. Russian propaganda outlets like RT and \\nSputnik successfully produced and peddled disinformation to \\nAmerican audiences in pursuit of Moscow's preferred outcome. \\nThis Russian propaganda on steroids was designed to poison the \\nnational conversation in America.\\n    The Russians employed thousands of paid internet trolls and \\nbotnets to push out disinformation and fake news at a high \\nvolume, focusing this material onto your Twitter and Facebook \\nfeeds and flooding our social media with misinformation. This \\nfake news and disinformation was then hyped by the American \\nmedia echo chamber and our own social media networks to reach \\nand potentially influence millions of Americans.\\n    This is not innuendo or false allegations. This is not fake \\nnews. This is actually what happened to us. Russia continues \\nthese sorts of actions as we speak. Some of our close allies in \\nEurope are experiencing exactly the same kind of interference \\nin their political process. Germany has said that its \\nparliament has been hacked. French presidential candidates \\nright now have been the subject of Russian propaganda and \\ndisinformation. In The Netherlands, their recent election, the \\nDutch hand-counted their ballots because they feared Russian \\ninterference in their electoral process. Perhaps most \\ncritically for us, there is nothing to stop them from doing \\nthis all over again in 2018 for those of you who are up or in \\n2020 as Americans again go back to the polls.\\n    In addition to what we already know, any full accounting \\nmust also find out what, if any, contacts, communications, or \\nconnections occurred between Russia and those associated with \\nthe campaigns themselves. I will not prejudge the outcome of \\nour investigation. We are seeking to determine if there is an \\nactual fire, but there is clearly a lot of smoke.\\n    For instance, an individual associated with the Trump \\ncampaign accurately predicted the release of hacked emails \\nweeks before it happened. This same individual also admits to \\nbeing in contact with Guccifer 2, the Russian intelligence \\npersona responsible for these cyber operations.\\n    The platform of one of our two major political parties was \\nmysteriously watered down in a way which promoted the interests \\nof President Putin and no one seems to be able to identify who \\ndirected that change in the platform.\\n    The campaign manager of one campaign who played such a \\ncritical role in electing the President was forced to step down \\nover his alleged ties to Russia and its associates.\\n    Since the election, we've seen the President's National \\nSecurity Adviser resign and his Attorney General recuse himself \\nover previously undisclosed contacts with the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n    And of course, in the other body on March 20th the Director \\nof the FBI publicly acknowledged that the Bureau was, quote, \\n``investigating the nature of any links between individuals \\nassociated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government \\nand whether there was any coordination between the campaign and \\nRussian efforts.'' End of quote.\\n    I want to make clear, at least for me, this investigation \\nis not about whether you have a ``D'' or an ``R'' next to your \\nname. It is not about relitigating last fall's election. It is \\nabout clearly understanding and responding to this very real \\nthreat. It's also, I believe, about holding Russia accountable \\nfor this unprecedented attack on our democracy. And it is about \\narming ourselves so we can identify and stop it when it happens \\nagain. And trust me, it will happen again if we don't take \\naction.\\n    I would hope that the President is as anxious as we are to \\nget to the bottom of what happened. But I have to say \\neditorially that the President's recent conduct, with his wild \\nand uncorroborated accusations about wiretapping and his \\ninappropriate and unjustified attacks on America's hardworking \\nintelligence professionals does give me grave concern.\\n    This committee has a heavy weight of responsibility to \\nprove that we can continue to put our political labels aside to \\nget us to the truth. I believe we can get there. I've seen \\nfirsthand--and I say this to our audience--how serious members \\non both sides of this dais have worked on this sensitive and \\ncritical issue.\\n    As the Chairman and I have said repeatedly, this \\ninvestigation will follow the facts where they lead us. If at \\nany time I believe we're not going to be able to get those \\nfacts--and we're working together very cooperatively to make \\nsure we get the facts that we need from the intelligence \\ncommunity. We will get that done.\\n    Mr. Chairman, again I thank you for your commitment to the \\nserious work and your commitment to keeping this bipartisan \\ncooperation at least, if not all across the Hill, alive in this \\ncommittee. Thank you very much.\\n    Chairman Burr. I thank the Vice Chairman.\\n    Members should note that they will be recognized by \\nseniority for five-minute questions. We'll go as expeditiously \\nas we can.\\n    Let me introduce our witnesses today if I may and we will \\nhear from those witnesses: Dr. Roy Godson, Emeritus Professor \\nof Government, Georgetown University.

Dr. Godson, you are recognized.\\n\\n     STATEMENT OF ROY GODSON, Ph.D., EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF \\n               GOVERNMENT, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY\\n\\n    Dr. Godson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Vice Chairman and \\nmembers of the committee, for inviting me to this hearing. I'd \\nlike to begin with just a minute or two on the long history of \\nSoviet active measures and then talk a little bit about some of \\nthe major advantages the Soviets and the Russians have reaped \\nfrom their history of using this instrument. Finally, I'd like \\nto come to what we have done in the past to reduce the \\neffectiveness of Soviet behavior and what we might want to \\nconsider for the future.\\n    I think if one looks at the history of the last 100 years \\nyou're going to find that the Russians and their Soviet \\npredecessors have believed that active measures is a major tool \\nfor their advancement. They actually believe, whatever we think \\nabout it, that this gives them the possibility of achieving \\ninfluence well beyond their economic and social status and \\nconditions in their country.\\n    I think when you look at what they say now, what they do \\nnow, and the way they act and practice and talk about their \\nactive measures, they take this subject very seriously.\\n    Sometimes we in the United States have been aware of this, \\nbut for many, many decades we did not take this subject \\nseriously and they were able to take enormous advantage. I \\nthink today that they basically believe they can use these \\ntechniques rather similarly to many of the ways they did this \\nin the past. I do think that they are repeating many of the \\nsame practices that they did in the past. Yes, there may be \\nsome new techniques that are being used now. In fact there are, \\nand some of my colleagues on the panel and this afternoon are \\nmore expert on those techniques, particularly the use of the \\ninternet and particularly cyberspace.\\n    But we can more or less rest assured that the Soviets will \\nbe looking at other techniques and will be seeking to adapt and \\nmake their active measures much more productive for them in the \\nfuture.\\n    Yes, the activities in the United States that you're \\nparticularly interested in do seem to be exceptional. We don't \\nhave very many other examples of where they interfered with \\nelection machinery and electoral apparatuses. What we do have \\nare many, many examples of where the Soviets, working together, \\nwere able, with their allies abroad, their agents of influence \\nabroad, to actually affect the elections in many, many \\ncountries in the 20th and early 21st centuries.\\n    The Soviets and their Russian successors took the view, \\ntake the view, that they are able to hit above their weight, \\nthey can fight above their weight, if they use active measures. \\nThey don't want to go to war. Neither of us wants to go to war. \\nBut they take the view that they can actually achieve a lot of \\nwhat they want to do through their active measures. That is, \\nthe combination of overt and covert techniques and resources, \\novert and covert combined together in one pattern, and that \\nthey have the authority and the responsibility as leaders of \\nthe country to be able to do that. And they put this into \\npractice.\\n    In the 1920s and 1930s they created an enormous apparatus \\nin the world. Russia was a poor, weak country and yet Russia in \\nthe 1920s and 1930s set up whole organizations, overt and \\ncovert, throughout the world that were able to challenge all \\nthe major powers of Europe and the United States. We may not \\nhave realized that these organizations were being set up, but \\nthey were considerable, and it took a lot of effort and skill \\non their part to do this.\\n    In the war, the Second World War, they used this apparatus \\nto be able to influence the politics of Europe after the war. \\nYes, they also used it during the war to help them, and \\nsometimes us, in fighting the Nazis and the Italian fascists. \\nBut in a major way they were also preparing for being able to \\ninfluence the outcome of the struggle for the balance of power \\nin Europe during World War II. So while they were an ally, they \\nwere also planning to undermine democratic and liberal parties, \\nincluding in the United States at that time.\\n    In fact, they were able to take advantage of the fact that \\nwe were friendly and that we were working together. Uncle Joe \\nwas a friend of the United States at that time, they thought, \\nand they were able to use that very successfully. So as a \\nresult, they were nearly able to take over the balance of power \\nin Western Europe. It was a closely run contest, and of course \\nwe're all glad that they lost. But it was a very closely run \\nconflict and we did emerge successfully from it.\\n    In the 1980s, they were on another roll. They used their \\napparat, which built up in, as I say, the 1920s and 1930s, \\n1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, to be able to achieve a great deal in \\nthe late 1970s and 1980s. They nearly were able to split \\nEurope, split NATO in Europe, in the 1980s. They started that \\nin the last year of the Carter Administration and continued \\ninto the Reagan years. Fortunately, we noticed this in time and \\nour rearmament of NATO went ahead and it wasn't because the \\nSoviets wanted it, but because we were able to outmaneuver \\nthem.\\n    The 1990s were sort of chaotic there and so their active \\nmeasures apparatus wasn't very effective and it didn't have the \\nkind of leadership that it had had before and the kind of \\nleadership it has gained since Vladimir Putin came to power. \\nIt's maybe a little bit too soon to do an assessment of their \\neffectiveness. So far, as was pointed out earlier by the \\nChairman and the Vice Chairman, we do think that they were \\neffective in an important way to us, and we understand that the \\ncommittee is going to be looking into this and studying this.\\n    But in any event, they have this apparatus. They have \\nmodernized it. They were spending billions of dollars a year \\nbefore. They have maybe 10 to 15,000 people in this apparatus \\nat least worldwide, in addition to the trolls and other kinds \\nof cyber capabilities they have.\\n    But the Soviets are not ten feet tall----\\n    Chairman Burr. Dr. Godson, I'm going to interrupt you for \\njust a second, just to make members aware that the second vote \\nhas started and it's our intent to work through this second \\nvote. So I'd ask members as they feel comfortable to leave for \\nthe vote, come right back if you will. As soon as we get \\nthrough the panel, we'll start questions.\\n    Dr. Godson, I'd just ask you to summarize as quickly as you \\ncan.\\n    Senator Feinstein. Mr. Chairman, how long is a round?\\n    Chairman Burr. Five-minute recognition.\\n    Dr. Godson. They're not ten feet tall. They have used their \\ncapabilities effectively, but they don't always win out.\\n    The United States for the first time responded in a major \\nway to them in the late 1940s through the 1960s. We did in fact \\ncauterize their active measures apparatus and they were not \\nable to successfully use it in Western Europe and other parts \\nof the world. We did some things pretty well from the 1940s to \\nthe 1960s.\\n    Unfortunately, in the 1960s the coalition between liberals \\nand conservatives, the consensus between the Congress and the \\nadministration, started to fall apart. Then, with the \\ncriticisms that the intelligence community had to take in that \\ntime, our countermeasures started to fall apart and we were \\nsort of disarming ourselves, if I can say that. So from the \\n1960s through the late 1970s we did not have a very effective \\ncounter-active measures capability and the Russians, of course, \\ntook advantage of that in numerous places in the world.\\n    In the 1980s, though, that changed. In the late 1970s, \\n1980s, it changed and we did start to do things well again. \\nI'll just summarize the fact that we started to develop a \\nstrategic approach to countermeasures. It wasn't a bit here and \\na bit there and so on. It was actually a strategic approach, \\nwith warning and anticipation of active measures. We actually \\nwould study them so well that we were able to often anticipate \\nwhat they were going to do with active measures and so \\ntherefore we could then use other measures to limit them and \\navoid the effectiveness of these active measures.\\n    We also started to support liberal elements abroad that we \\nthought would be helpful to us in preventing Soviet active \\nmeasures from furthering Soviet objectives in those societies.\\n    So we were fairly successful in the 1980s in doing this and \\nin both using overt and covert methods to do this. As in other \\nvictories that we've had after World War I or after World War \\nII, after the Cold War we thought that this wasn't such an \\nimportant thing to be doing any more and so our activities \\nwaned. They didn't stop, but they waned. We had some units that \\nremained in the government that were concerned with this, but \\non the whole the government actually disarmed itself.\\n    So although there were some in the government and outside \\nthe government who warned about the Soviet use of active \\nmeasures--and I do know when looking over the website of your \\ncommittee that some of the people in this room actually went to \\nthe government and asked the government to be more mindful of \\nSoviet active measures starting in 2016, and presumably we \\nshould be mindful of it afterwards--unfortunately, the \\ngovernment did not take the warnings as seriously as it could \\nhave and made this known to the public in a useful fashion so \\nwe would not be so surprised when this took place in the--or \\nappears to have taken place in 2016.\\n    But the Soviets could not have done this and the Russians \\ncould not have done this without having an active measures \\napparatus. It's visible. One can find it. One can't find \\neverything about it, but we have--historically, we know that we \\ncan find it, we can anticipate it, and we can take a number of \\nmeasures. So I hope you will have time to consider, maybe in \\nthe questioning, some of the measures we could now take to do \\nthat.\\n    Thank you.\\n    [The prepared statement of Dr. Godson follows:]\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n     \\n    Chairman Burr. Thank you, Dr. Godson.\\n    Dr. Rumer.\\n\\n    STATEMENT OF EUGENE B. RUMER, Ph.D., SENIOR FELLOW AND \\n DIRECTOR, RUSSIA AND EURASIA PROGRAM, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR \\n                      INTERNATIONAL PEACE\\n\\n    Dr. Rumer. Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Warner, \\ndistinguished members of the committee: I'm honored to be here \\ntoday.\\n    Russian active measures and interference in our \\npresidential campaign is one of the most contentious issues in \\nour national conversation. I believe that Russian intelligence \\nservices and their proxies intervened in our election in 2016. \\nI have not seen the classified evidence behind the intelligence \\ncommunity assessment published a few weeks ago. Some have \\ncriticized it for not sharing the evidence of Russian \\nintrusions. They miss the mark. It is the totality of Russian \\nefforts in plain sight to mislead, to misinform, to exaggerate, \\nthat is more convincing than any cyber evidence. RT, Russia \\nToday Broadcast, internet trolls, fake news, and so on are an \\nintegral part of Russian foreign policy to date.\\n    We need to put this in the context of the quarter century \\nsince the end of the Cold War. World War II in Europe, or ``the \\nGreat Patriotic War,'' as Russians call it, is integral to the \\nformative experience of every living Russian. The country's \\nnational narrative is impossible without it.\\n    In 1941 Hitler's armies were just outside the gates of \\nMoscow. In 1945 Stalin's armies entered Berlin. That was \\nRussia's greatest generation. Generations of Russians since \\nthen have been taught that their country was at its most secure \\nthen because it was protected by a buffer: the Warsaw Pact and \\nthe Soviet empire.\\n    In 1991, Russians lost that buffer, the legacy of their \\ngreatest generation. With their country falling apart, Russian \\nleaders had no choice but to accept this loss for as long as \\nRussia would remain weak. The 1990s were a terrible decade for \\nRussia, but a great decade for the West. For Russian leaders \\nand many regular Russians, the dominance of the West came at \\nthe expense of Russia's loss in the Cold War.\\n    But Russia would not remain weak indefinitely. Its economic \\nrecovery led to a return to a much more assertive posture, \\naggressive posture some would say, on the world stage. We saw \\nit in the crushing of Georgia in 2008, in the annexation of \\nCrimea in 2014, and we see it to the present day in the ongoing \\nwar in eastern Ukraine.\\n    For the West, Russia's return to the world stage has been \\nnothing more than pure revanchism. For Russia, it is restoring \\nsome balance in their relationship with the West. The narrative \\nof restoring the balance, correcting the injustice and the \\ndistortions of the 1990s, has been the essential--has been \\nabsolutely essential to Russian propaganda since the beginning \\nof the Putin era. Those Russians who disagree are branded as \\nforeign agents and enemies of the people.\\n    But Russia's capabilities should not be overestimated. Its \\nGDP is about $1.3 trillion versus U.S. GDP of over $18 \\ntrillion. Russian defense spending is estimated at about $65 \\nbillion. That's little more than President Trump's proposed \\nincrease in U.S. defense spending for fiscal year 2018.\\n    The Russian military is undeniably stronger than its \\nsmaller and weaker neighbors. Yet the balance does not favor \\nRussia when compared to NATO. A NATO-Russia war would be an act \\nof mutual suicide and the Kremlin is not ready for it.\\n    Russian leaders have embraced a difficult toolkit--\\ninformation warfare, intimidation, espionage, economic tools, \\nand so on. This toolkit is meant to make up for Russia's \\nconventional shortcomings vis-a-vis the West.\\n    The Kremlin has a number of advantages here. The circle of \\ndeciders is limited to a handful of Putin associates with \\nsimilar world views. They have considerable resources at their \\ndisposal, especially since most of their tools are quite cheap. \\nA handful of cyber criminals costs a lot less than an armored \\nbrigade, but can do a lot of damage.\\n    Russian meddling in our presidential election most likely \\nis viewed by the Kremlin as an unqualified success. The payoffs \\ninclude, but are not limited to: one, a major distraction to \\nthe United States, for the United States; damage to U.S. \\nleadership in the world; and perhaps most importantly, the \\ndemonstration effect. The Kremlin can do this to the world's \\nsole remaining global superpower. Imagine how other countries \\nfeel.\\n    The differences between Russia and the United States are \\nprofound and will not be resolved soon. This is not a crisis, \\nnot something that will pass soon. It is the new normal. We \\nwill see Russia relying on this toolkit in the months and years \\nto come, in the upcoming elections in France and in Germany \\nthis year, in our own future political campaigns.\\n    Deception and active measures have long been and will \\nremain a staple of Russian dealings with the outside world for \\nthe foreseeable future.\\n    Thank you.\\n    [The prepared statement of Dr. Rumer follows:]\\n    \\n  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n  \\n      \\n    Chairman Burr. Dr. Rumer, thank you.\\n    Mr. Watts.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF CLINT WATTS, ROBERT A. FOX FELLOW, FOREIGN POLICY \\n                       RESEARCH INSTITUTE\\n\\n    Mr. Watts. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee: thank \\nyou for inviting me here today.\\n    In April 2014, Andrew Weisburd, J.M. Berger, and I noticed \\na petition on the WhiteHouse.gov website. ``Alaska Back to \\nRussia'' appeared as a public campaign to give America's \\nlargest state back to the nation from which it was purchased. \\nSatirical or nonsensical petitions appearing on the White House \\nwebsite are not out of the norm. But this petition was \\ndifferent, having gained more than 39,000 online signatures in \\na short period.\\n    Our examining of those signing and posting on this petition \\nrevealed an odd pattern. The accounts varied considerably from \\nother petitions and appeared to be the work of bots. A closer \\nlook at those bots tied in closely with other social media \\ncampaigns we had observed pushing Russian propaganda months \\nbefore. Hackers proliferated the networks and could be spotted \\namong recent data breaches and website defacements. Closely \\ncircling those hackers were honeypot accounts, attractive-\\nlooking women and political partisans that were trying to \\nsocial engineer other users.\\n    Above all, we observed hecklers, those synchronized \\ntrolling accounts you see on Twitter that would attack \\npolitical targets using similar talking patterns and points. \\nThose accounts, some of which overtly support the Kremlin, \\npromoted Russian foreign policy positions targeting key \\nEnglish-speaking audiences throughout Europe and North America.\\n    Soviet active measures strategy and tactics have been \\nreborn and updated for the modern Russian regime and the \\ndigital age. Today Russia hopes to win the second Cold War \\nthrough the force of politics, as opposed to the politics of \\nforce.\\n    While Russia certainly seeks to promote Western candidates \\nsympathetic to their worldview and foreign policy objectives, \\nwinning a single election is not their end goal. Russian active \\nmeasures hope to topple democracies through the pursuit of five \\ncomplementary objectives:\\n    One, undermine citizen confidence in democratic governance;\\n    Two, foment and exacerbate divisive political fissures;\\n    Three, erode trust between citizens and elected officials \\nand their institutions;\\n    Four, popularize Russian policy agendas within foreign \\npopulations;\\n    And five, create general distrust or confusion over \\ninformation sources by blurring the lines between fact and \\nfiction, a very pertinent issue today in our country.\\n    From these objectives, the Kremlin can crumble democracies \\nfrom the inside out, achieving two key milestones: one, the \\ndissolution of the European Union; and two, the breakup of \\nNATO. Achieving these two victories against the West will allow \\nRussia to reassert its power globally and pursue its foreign \\npolicy objectives bilaterally through military, diplomatic, and \\neconomic aggression.\\n    In late 2014 and throughout 2015, we watched active \\nmeasures on nearly any disaffected U.S. audience. Whether it be \\nclaims of the U.S. military declaring martial law during the \\nJade Helm exercise, chaos amongst Black Lives Matter protests, \\nor a standoff at the Bundy Ranch, Russia's state-sponsored RT \\nand Sputnik News, characterized as white outlets, churned out \\nmanipulated truths, false news stories, and conspiracies. They \\ngenerally lined up under four themes:\\n    One, political messages designed to tarnish democratic \\nleaders and institutions;\\n    Two, financial propaganda, created to weaken confidence in \\nfinancial markets and capitalist economies;\\n    Three, social unrest, crafted to amplify divisions amongst \\ndemocratic populaces;\\n    And four, global calamity, pushed to incite fear of global \\ndemise, such as nuclear war or catastrophic climate change.\\n    From these overt Russian propaganda outlets, a wide range \\nof English-speaking conspiratorial websites, which we refer to \\nas gray outlets, some of which mysteriously operate from \\nEastern Europe and are curiously led by pro-Russian editors of \\nunknown financing, sensationalize these conspiracies and fake \\nnews published by white outlets.\\n    American-looking social media accounts, hecklers, \\nhoneypots, and hackers I described earlier, working alongside \\nautomated bots, further amplify this Russian propaganda amongst \\nunwitting Westerners.\\n    Through the end of 2015, the start of 2016, the Russian \\ninfluence system began pushing themes and messages seeking to \\ninfluence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. \\nRussia's overt media outlets and covert trolls sought to \\nsideline opponents on both sides of the political spectrum with \\nadversarial views toward the Kremlin. They were in full swing \\nduring both the Republican and Democratic primary season and \\nmay have helped sink the hopes of candidates more hostile to \\nRussian interests long before the field narrowed. Senator \\nRubio, in my opinion you anecdotally suffered from these \\nefforts.\\n    The final piece of Russia's modern active measures surfaced \\nin the summer of 2016 as hacked materials were strategically \\nleaked. The disclosures of WikiLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and DCLeaks \\ndemonstrated how hacks would power the influence system Russia \\nhad built so successfully in the previous two years.\\n    As an example, on the evening of 30 July 2016 my colleagues \\nand I watched as RT and Sputnik News simultaneously launched \\nfalse stories of the U.S. air base at Incirlik, Turkey, being \\noverrun by terrorists. Within minutes, pro-Russian social media \\naggregators and automated bots amplified this false news story. \\nMore than 4,000 tweets in the first 78 minutes after launching \\nthis false story going back to the active measures accounts we \\nhad tracked in the previous two years.\\n    These previously identified accounts almost simultaneously, \\nappearing from difficult geographic locations and communities, \\namplified the fake news story in unison. The hashtags pushed by \\nthese accounts were ``nuclear,'' ``media,'' ``Trump,'' and \\n``Benghazi.'' The most common words found in English-speaking \\nTwitter profiles were ``God,'' ``military,'' ``Trump,'' \\n``family,'' ``country,'' ``conservative,'' ``Christian,'' \\n``America,'' and ``Constitution.''\\n    These accounts and their messages clearly sought to \\nconvince Americans a U.S. military base was being overrun in a \\nterrorist attack. In reality, a small protest gathered outside \\nthe gate and the increased security at the air base sought to \\nsecure the arrival of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\\n    Many of the accounts we watched push the false Incirlik \\nstory today focus on the elections in Europe, promoting fears \\nof immigration or false claims of refugee criminality. They \\nhave not forgotten about the U.S., either. This past week we \\nobserved social media accounts discrediting Speaker of the \\nHouse Paul Ryan, hoping to further foment unrest inside U.S. \\ndemocratic institutions.\\n    The implications of Russia's new active measures model will \\nbe twofold. The first is what the world is witnessing today, a \\nRussian challenge to democracy throughout the West. But more \\nimportantly, over the horizon Russia has provided any \\nauthoritarian dictator or predatory elite equipped with hackers \\nand disrespectful of civil liberties a playbook to dismantle \\ntheir enemies through information warfare.\\n    The U.S., in failing to respond to active measures, will \\nsurrender its position as the world's leader, forego its role \\nas chief promoter and defender of democracy, and give up on \\nover 70 years of collective action to preserve freedom and \\ncivil liberties around the world.\\n    Russia's strategic motto for America and the West is: \\n``Divided they stand and divided they will fall.'' It's time \\nthe United States reminds the world that, despite our day to \\nday policy debates and political squabbles, we stand united \\nalongside our allies in defending our democratic system of \\ngovernment from the meddling of power-hungry tyrants and \\nrepressive authoritarians that prey on their people and \\nsuppress humanity.\\n    I'll close here with my opening remarks, but I have many \\nrecommendations which are in my written testimony. Mr. \\nChairman, I ask that my full written statement, which includes \\nthese recommendations, be submitted for the record, and I hope \\nthat during the question and answer session we can further \\ndiscuss how we might counter these active measures. Thank you \\nfor inviting me.\\n    [The prepared statement of Mr. Watts follows:]\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n        \\n    Chairman Burr. Mr. Watts, thank you for your testimony, and \\nall written testimony will be included as part of the record.\\n    The Chair and the Vice Chairman are going to exit and vote. \\nI'm going to recognize Senator Risch for his questions and in \\nour absence he'll allow back and forth based upon seniority.\\n    Senator Risch.\\n    Senator Risch [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Gentlemen, it always impresses me the fact that when we \\nhear people talking about Russian policy and what they want, \\nfirst of all, how uniform it is. Everybody seems to agree on \\nwhere they're going, what they do and what they're doing to get \\nthere. But after processing that over a long period of time, \\none's got to come to the thought process of what happens in a \\npost-Putin Russia, because everyone's got a shelf life and his \\nhas been extended, it looks to me, well beyond what normally \\nwould happen under these circumstances.\\n    So give me your thoughts briefly, each of you, if you \\nwould, as to what happens? Do they stay on the same track \\nthey're on or do they come to the realization that there's \\nbigger and better things in life to pursue than what they're \\ndoing right now?\\n    Mr. Godson.\\n    Dr. Godson. Well, thank you for the question. As you know, \\nthere are a lot of variables here at work. One would be what \\nwe--how we respond to Putin and the behavior of the apparatus \\nthat they have. Do we let them continue to do this or do we \\nstart to develop some sort of a strategic response to that? \\nThat would be one of the variables.\\n    Do they find that they can get away with, use activities as \\nthey have in the past? And if so, then the elite that has taken \\npower in Russia would be inclined to continue. They found that \\neven when they sometimes have not been as effective as they \\nexpected, that active measures still is a capability that \\nenables them to--I use the example of being able to fight above \\ntheir economic and political capabilities.\\n    So unless there was a dramatic change in the regime, \\nthere's little reason to believe that they would cease the \\nactive measures policy and strategy they have, barring that we \\ndon't actually cauterize it and limit its effectiveness. If we \\ndon't, then they'll have an incentive to continue.\\n    Senator Risch. Dr. Rumer.\\n    Dr. Rumer. Thank you, sir. Well, Mr. Putin I believe is 62, \\na man in his prime. He's positioned to run in 2018 again for \\nanother six-year term. So I think what we see today is going to \\nbe with us for a long time, by the looks of it for the next two \\npresidential terms in this country. So we should base our \\npolicy accordingly.\\n    I think it would be incorrect and counterproductive to tar \\nall Russians with the same brush. But there's something there \\nin Russian traditional security perceptions that transcends \\nparty lines, that transcends regimes, and Russian perceptions \\nof security don't really change all that much over time. So I \\nthink we should be thinking about the drivers of Russian \\nforeign and security policy in terms of continuity rather than \\nradical change. After all, we already saw radical change in \\n1991 and things in the end didn't really change that much.\\n    As long as Russian elites will see themselves--as long as \\nthey see themselves as being inferior and struggling against a \\nmore advanced and a more powerful Western alliance, they will \\nbe relying on all tools in their toolkit, and information \\nwarfare will be--disinformation will be part of it.\\n    We may hope that if some day someone like the corruption \\nfighter Alexei Navalny gets elected, rises to the leadership of \\nthe country, having been a victim of such disinformation, he \\nmay be more restrained in it. But I would say that the basic \\nparameters of Russian policy are generally set in place.\\n    Senator Risch. Thank you, Doctor. I've only got a short \\ntime left. I want to hear from Mr. Watts.\\n    Mr. Watts. Regarding Mr. Putin, I would look to these two \\ngentlemen primarily. But my thoughts are: one, he's not going \\naway any time soon; two, he will definitely shape some sort of \\na successor in his place to continue on with what he's doing \\nright now.\\n    I think the third big thing that we can't discount is the \\nconnection with criminality. There is--between these elites and \\ntheir sort of predatory capitalist practices, what we see in \\ncyberspace with cybercrime and how they've used hackers very \\nwell as part of their active measures, we can't discount that \\nwe'll see a predatory elite emerge that will be something we \\nhave to deal with.\\n    I think the fourth thing, which goes to the first point, is \\nI'm not sure what our policy or stance is with regards to \\nRussia at this point in the United States. I think that's the \\nnumber one thing we have to figure out, because that will shape \\nhow they interface with us. Having watched the end of the \\nSoviet Union as a cadet at West Point and then fast forwarding \\nto today, I'm a little bit lost as to what our U.S. interests \\nare or how they're coalescing. I know what I would recommend, \\nbut I think that will have a major impact on how we will be \\nable to interface. And maybe I see opportunity in Putin's \\ndeparture.\\n    Senator Risch. Thank you, Mr. Watts.\\n    Senator Feinstein.\\n    Senator Feinstein. Thank you, Senator Risch.\\n    Gentlemen, thank you very much for being here and thank you \\nfor your testimony. I'm sorry I was out to vote while I missed \\nsome of it. But I've been on this committee for 16 years and \\nthe intelligence community report, which is the report of all \\nof our major intelligence agencies which was released on \\nJanuary 6th, is among the strongest I've read. It covers the \\nmotivation and the scope of Russia's actions regarding our \\nelections, as well as the cyber tools and the media campaigns \\nthey used to influence public opinion.\\n    The report makes a key judgment and here it is: ``Russian \\nPresident Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 \\naimed at the United States political election, the consistent \\ngoals of which were to undermine public faith in the United \\nStates' democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton and \\nharm her electability and potential presidency.''\\n    It further assesses that, and these are quotes: ``Putin and \\nthe Russian government developed a clear preference for \\nPresident-elect Trump.''\\n    Here's two questions. Do you believe the Intelligence \\nCommunity Assessment accurately characterized the goals of \\nRussian influence activities in the election? And I'd like to \\ngo down the line with a yes or no answer. If you want to \\nexplain it, that would be fine. Who would like to go first?\\n    Dr. Godson. Thank you for a difficult question. I \\npersonally don't find myself at odds with the ICA study that \\nyou identified However, the statement that this was developed \\nin 2016 needs to be parsed a bit. The Russians could not do \\nthis if they started in 2016. They wouldn't have had the \\ncapability. In the active measures world, one can want to do \\nmany things, but one has to have the means to do this.\\n    Senator Feinstein. When would you estimate it was started \\nby your statement?\\n    Dr. Godson. Well, it's not that I have a specific date, but \\nthat one needs to have an infrastructure abroad to be able to \\ndo this. Now, you can use some of the infrastructure in your \\nown country, especially with cyber capabilities, but----\\n    Senator Feinstein. Which they had.\\n    Dr. Godson. Which they had. But active measures usually \\ninvolve people as well as machines. And it would be \\nextraordinary if they hadn't prepared a lot of the ground to be \\nable to do this, not only in the United States, but in other \\ncountries as well. They have this apparatus, and this apparatus \\nis well-staffed, well-trained.\\n    The training of the people who work in this apparatus is \\nquite surprising to us. We've known about it, but we don't \\nreally take it very seriously. It's not three months or six \\nmonths training or a year's training. They have much longer \\ntraining periods and some of them are pretty good, not ten feet \\ntall, of course, but pretty good.\\n    Senator Feinstein. I got the point.\\n    Next person.\\n    Dr. Rumer. Yes.\\n    Senator Feinstein. Thank you. I appreciate it.\\n    Mr. Watts. Yes, and I can give you the timeline of their \\ndevelopment if you would like.\\n    Senator Feinstein. Please.\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. We have accounts dating back to 2009 \\nthat are tied to active measures. 2014 was their capability \\ndevelopment based on my assessment, where they started working \\non their influence campaigns. 2015 was when they tied hacking \\nand influence together for the first time, specifically during \\nthe DNC breaches. I was notified in November of 2015 that I had \\nbeen targeted by a cyber attack.\\n    2016 was the push into the U.S. audience landscape to build \\naudience. August 2016 was when I witnessed them pushing toward \\nthe election and that was in full--or August of 2015 all the \\nway through 2016, so a one-year buildup to the election.\\n    Senator Feinstein. Thank you.\\n    Has Russia ever--I think I know the answer to this, but if \\nyou would elaborate on it--conducted other similar campaigns in \\nother countries to this level of impact with the goal of \\ntilting the playing field to increase one candidate's chance of \\nwinning?\\n    Mr. Watts, if you'd go first.\\n    Mr. Watts. Yes. I believe you need to look back to 2014 in \\nboth Ukraine and another Eastern European country that's \\nescaping me. In 2015, 2016, the Brexit campaign should be \\nexamined. I can't prove it one way or another. And then today, \\nall of the European elections that they're choosing to meddle \\nin--France, Germany, Netherlands, Czech Republic.\\n    Senator Feinstein. Thank you.\\n    Would you like to respond?\\n    Dr. Rumer. Yes, they have conducted such campaigns in \\nUkraine in 2004 and in 2014 in Georgia. They have intervened \\nheavily in domestic political campaigns in the Baltic States. \\nSo there are ample examples of that.\\n    Senator Feinstein. Thank you.\\n    Would you please respond, Doctor?\\n    Dr. Godson. Yes, they have a history of doing this well \\nbefore this and they find it a successful use of their \\nresources. So it does not surprise.\\n    Senator Risch. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you, Senator \\nFeinstein.\\n    Senator Rubio.\\n    Senator Rubio. Thank you.\\n    Thank you all for being here. I'm concerned that in our \\ninquiry--and I certainly think it's important for us to know \\nwhat happened--we are focusing so much on the tactics that \\nwe're not focusing on the broader strategy that's at play here. \\nI want to briefly go through a number of instances and have the \\npanel comment on whether or not they believe these are \\nindicative of the efforts that are being targeted against the \\nUnited States and the rest of the world by Vladimir Putin.\\n    We all know that Angela Merkel has taken a tough line on \\nUkraine against Russia. We know that there's a lot of \\ncontroversy in Germany around migrants. In early 2016, a 13-\\nyear-old known only as ``Lisa S.,'' a dual Russian-German \\ncitizen whose family had moved to Germany from Russia in 2004, \\ntold police she had been kidnapped in East Berlin by what \\nappeared to be Middle Eastern migrants and raped for over 30 \\nhours. There was outrage in Germany and, obviously, protests \\nagainst Merkel.\\n    The Russian foreign minister almost immediately jumped on \\nthe story, talking about the need to defend ``our'' Lisa, \\nquote-unquote, and of course this story was spread far and wide \\nby Russian-speaking entities and Russian media outlets.\\n    Subsequently, the prosecutors in Berlin announced that they \\nhad clear evidence that during those 30 hours she was missing, \\nLisa S. was actually in fact with people that she knew and a \\nmedical examination showed that she had not been the victim of \\na rape.\\n    Earlier this year, a little-known news outlet published on \\na website an article that claimed that the United States was \\ndeploying 3,600 tanks to Eastern Europe to prepare for war with \\nRussia. 3,600 tanks would represent about 40 percent of our \\nentire tank force. Within days the story was republished by \\ndozens of outlets in the United States and throughout Europe. \\nAs it turns out, the truth is we deployed 87 tanks.\\n    There is--going all the way back to September 11, 2015, \\nresidents in Louisiana awoke to a message, many of them did, on \\ntheir Twitter feed that said: ``Toxic fume hazard warning in \\nthis area until 1:30 p.m. Take shelter, check local media and \\nColumbiaChemical.com.''\\n    On Twitter accounts, there were hundreds of accounts \\ndocumenting a disaster right down the road from the people. One \\naccount said: ``A powerful explosion heard from miles away at a \\nchemical plant in Centerville, Louisiana,'' a man named John \\nMerritt tweeted. @AnnaRoussella shared an image of flames \\nengulfing the plant. @Quesera12 posted a video of surveillance \\nfootage from the local gas station capturing the explosion. \\nAnother Twitter account posted a screenshot of CNN's home page \\nshowing the story had already made national news, claiming that \\nISIS had claimed credit for the attack, according to one \\nYouTube video.\\n    A woman named @Zopakdon9--Anna Clinton McLaren is her name, \\nI guess--tweeted to Karl Rove: ``Karl, is this really ISIS \\nresponsible for the #ColumbiaChemicals? Tell Obama we should \\nbomb Iraq.''\\n    If anyone had taken the trouble to check CNN, as this \\narticle in The New York Times outlined, there was no such \\nattack. It was a hoax, not some simple prank, as the article \\ngoes on to say, but a highly coordinated disinformation \\ncampaign involving dozens of fake accounts that posted hundreds \\nof tweets for hours, targeting a list of figures precisely \\nchosen to generate maximum attention.\\n    ``The perpetrators didn't just doctor screen shots from \\nCNN''--and I'm reading from the New York Times article--``they \\nalso created functional clones of the websites of the Louisiana \\nTV stations and the like.''\\n    The list goes on and on. We should fully document it in our \\nreport to the American people. A false story spreading, \\nclaiming that Germany's oldest church had been burned down by a \\nthousand Muslims chanting ``Allah Akbar.'' Another story \\nclaiming that the European Union was planning to ban snowmen as \\nracist.\\n    All of this, and on and on, and we should begin to document \\nthem for the American people. Isn't this the larger problem? \\nLet me rephrase that. Aren't we in the midst of a blitzkrieg, \\nfor lack of a better term, of informational warfare conducted \\nby Russian trolls under the command of Vladimir Putin, designed \\nto sow instability, pit us against each other as Americans?\\n    This same article--I don't have enough time--it goes on: \\nThey posted false stories about a police shooting in Atlanta \\nthat never happened, about a series of things. In essence, are \\nwe in danger here because we are focused on the very important \\ntactical move that happened in the election of 2016, to miss \\nthe broader point, and that is that this is a coordinated \\neffort across multiple spectrums to sow instability and to pit \\nAmericans against one another politically, socioeconomically, \\ndemographically, and the like?\\n    Mr. Watts. I think the two lines of effort you brought up \\nthere that the Russians use are social dynamics that they play \\non, ethnic divisions, and global calamity or inciting fear. \\nThese two lines haven't been discussed much. The third one is \\nfinancial. They oftentimes put out fake stories about U.S. \\ncompanies, which then cause stock dips, which allow all sorts \\nof predatory trading and other things to happen.\\n    We've focused on disinformation around the political scene. \\nBut misinformation across the board, particularly from the \\nRussian propaganda networks, has incited fear inside the United \\nStates on multiple occasions, as you noted. One last year was \\nthere was the JFK Terminal shutdown about alleged gunshots. We \\nwatched social media trolls and gray outlets pump fake stories \\nout which ramped up that fear, which caused mass panic.\\n    So they have created the ability, by gaining audience in \\nthe United States, to steer Americans unwittingly in many \\ndifficult directions that can cause all sorts of danger and \\neven violence in certain cases. I think the Pizzagate scandal \\nthat we saw last fall is another such example of \\nmisinformation, maybe not attributed to Russia, but we have a \\nproblem writ large right now with our information sources.\\n    Senator Risch. Senator Rubio, do you want to----\\n    Senator Rubio. No, I want to listen.\\n    Dr. Godson. I think you hit the nail on the head and I \\ndon't really have a lot to add to it. We are faced with a \\nstrategic attack. It's not a kinetic attack usually. It's a \\npolitical attack. Then the question comes what sort of \\nstrategic response are we going to be able to develop to that, \\nthat attack? We could elaborate on that.\\n    Senator Risch. Senator Warner.\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. Again, I thank all the witnesses for \\nthe testimony.\\n    Dr. Rumer, I'm going to start with you. We've heard a lot \\nrecently about the role of Oleg Deripaska, the head of Russia's \\nlargest aluminum company, and the role he may have played in \\nhelping to support the goals of President Putin. Can you \\ncharacterize Mr. Deripaska's role in this area? And then more \\nbroadly, are there any of the oligarchs in Russia, at least \\nthose not in exile, that aren't somehow caught up in the \\nKremlin's foreign policy activities? Are there any of them that \\nare truly independent?\\n    Dr. Rumer. Thank you, Senator Warner. I can't add anything \\nto the conversation about Mr. Deripaska beyond what's appeared \\nin the public domain. I don't think I have any special insights \\nhere. I feed off the same reporting that's appeared in the \\npapers.\\n    I would be careful to describe all Russian oligarchs--and \\n``oligarch'' itself is a fairly ill-defined term. It was \\nprominent once, but it's a much bigger class of major Russian \\nbusinessmen.\\n    I would be reluctant to describe them all as tools of the \\nKremlin. Obviously, Russian businessmen who do business in \\nRussia have to be mindful of Kremlin political preferences and \\nthe Kremlin has considerable influence over them. But I don't \\nhave--I can't speak from concrete information about them being \\ndirectly instruments of the Kremlin foreign policy. That's not \\nsomething that I have evidence to back up.\\n    So I think I'll stop at that.\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. Mr. Watts, one of the things in your \\ntestimony--I've been talking a lot about the use of the \\ninternet trolls and their ability to then exponentially gain \\nmore power through creating these botnets. I'd love you to kind \\nof comment about what we can do to preclude that on a going-\\nforward basis, and perhaps you can explain this technique \\nbetter than I have in my various public statements.\\n    Mr. Watts. Sure. The first thing that I think we need to \\nunderstand is it's not all automated and it's not all human. \\nThere's a combination of the two. So you have a series of \\nhumans that work in their psychological warfare groups, that \\ncommand both bots at the same time. I like to, as an analogy, \\nto look at it like artillery. You have someone who's engaging \\nwith you as an individual and at the same time they can launch \\na bot to amplify that story forward.\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. Obviously, a ``bot'' is the ability \\nfor a computer to take over other computers that are not being \\nused and in effect magnify the number of hits they might get to \\na particular social media site, correct?\\n    Mr. Watts. Exactly. Or you can create more personas in \\nTwitter, for example, which makes it look like there are more \\npeople than there really are. It's a Potemkin village strategy \\nessentially that amplifies your appearance.\\n    So what they do is they launch those simultaneously as they \\nbegin the engagement or push of false news stories, usually \\nfrom RT and Sputnik News. They do that in unison, which games \\nthe social media system such that such a high volume of content \\nbeing pushed at the same time raises that into the trends that \\nyou'll see.\\n    If you look at Facebook or Twitter or whatever it might be, \\nyou'll see the top ten stories that are out right now. It \\npushes that up there. As soon as it pushes that into that top \\nten feed, mainstream media outlets then are watching that and \\nthey start to examine that content.\\n    So, for example, the Incirlik attack I talked about, one of \\nthe key hashtags they pushed is #Media. The goal is to get that \\ninto the top of Twitter streams so that mainstream media has to \\nrespond to that story. When mainstream media responds to it or \\njust looks at it without even commenting on it, it takes over \\norganically and you'll see it move around the internet like a \\nvirus.\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. One thing--and I'm going to spend a \\nlot of time on this this afternoon--there have been reports \\nthat their ability to target this information, some reports at \\nleast, saying that in the last week of the campaign in certain \\nprecincts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, there was \\nso much misinformation coming out talking about Hillary \\nClinton's illnesses or Hillary Clinton stealing money from the \\nState Department, that it completely blanked out any of the \\nback and forth that was actually going on in the campaign.\\n    One of the things that seems curious is, would the Russians \\non their own have that level of sophisticated knowledge about \\nthe American political system if they didn't at least get some \\nadvice from someone in America?\\n    Mr. Watts. Yes. I know this from working on influence \\ncampaigns in the counterterrorism context. If you do an \\nappropriate target audience analysis on social media, you can \\nactually identify an audience in a foreign country or in the \\nUnited States, parse out all of their preferences. Part of the \\nreason those bios had ``conservative,'' ``Christian,'' \\n``America,'' all those terms in it, is those are the most \\ncommon ones. If you inhale all the accounts of people in \\nWisconsin, you identify the most common terms in it, you just \\nrecreate accounts that look exactly like people from Wisconsin.\\n    So that way, whenever you're trying to socially engineer \\nthem and convince them that the information is true, it's much \\nmore simple because you see somebody and they look exactly like \\nyou, even down to the pictures. When you look at the pictures, \\nit looks like an American from the Midwest or the South or \\nWisconsin or whatever the location is.\\n    And they will change those. They can reprogram them. Where \\nthey tend to show their hand is, the problem is once they build \\nan audience they don't want to get rid of it. So you'll see \\nthem build an audience and try and influence one segment, let's \\nsay of the English-speaking media, and then they will reprogram \\nit to try and influence a different story. It's the same \\nproblem any cable news outlet would have. Once you build an \\naudience and you change your content to some other topic, you \\nstill want to keep your old audience or otherwise you can't \\ngain any traction.\\n    Vice Chairman Warner. Again, my time is up, but I just want \\nto know: This can be used--it was used in 2016 toward one \\ncandidate, but obviously Russia's interests are Russia's \\ninterests.\\n    Mr. Watts. Well, it's used right now against people on both \\nsides of the aisle. We will watch them play both sides. They \\nmight go after a Republican person in this room tomorrow and \\nthen they'll switch. It's solely based on what they want to \\nachieve in their own landscape, whatever the Russian foreign \\npolicy objectives are.\\n    So if they want to achieve one candidate--let's say \\nPresident Trump, for example, wins and now turns against them; \\nthey will turn on President Trump as well. They will play--they \\nwin because they play both sides, and the audience will go with \\nthem once they have them.\\n    Chairman Burr [presiding]. I do know that the Vice Chairman \\nhates Russia, just to make that public.\\n    Senator Collins.\\n    Senator Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Dr. Godson, you make the point that the Russians don't \\nalways win with their active measures and you mentioned the \\nperiod of the 1940s and the 1950s. In your judgment, how \\nsuccessful have the Russians been in the last year in achieving \\ntheir goal of sowing doubt, polarization, and trying to disrupt \\nand cast doubt on the validity of the election, putting aside \\nthe issue for the moment of the critical question of whether \\nthere was any collusion between any campaign and the Russian \\nefforts?\\n    Dr. Godson. From the information that we have in the public \\nsector and the private sector, I would say that they must be \\nrather pleased with the results of their investment, whenever \\nthey started to develop this campaign.\\n    I think, though, however, they--and the fact is that they \\nare seeming to prepare to do the same thing in other campaigns \\nabroad. So looking at the way they've behaved over the long \\ncourse of time that they've used active measures, I think they \\nwill continue to do this and to reap some benefits from it, \\nunless there is a considerable response from the democratic \\nsocieties. At the moment, I would say that our response is too \\nrestrained and that, unless they see that there is a cost to \\nthis that makes this not a very attractive thing to do, I don't \\nsee why they won't continue it.\\n    I hope that's responsive.\\n    Senator Collins. Thank you.\\n    Dr. Rumer, Mr. Watts made the point that the Russians will \\ngo after either side, that they're trying to disrupt society, \\ncast doubt on Western democracies. One largely overlooked part \\nof the Intelligence Committee's--the intelligence community's \\nreport last fall was information in the annex that suggested \\nthat Russia Today, which most people view as an organ of the \\nRussian government, was instrumental in trying to advance the \\nprotests of Occupy Wall Street.\\n    Could you comment on that, and is that an example of Russia \\nworking to promote the far left versus the far right that we \\nhear so much about?\\n    Dr. Rumer. Yes, ma'am. It's a perfect example in that \\nOccupy Wall Street was a genuine movement on the left, but it \\ncertainly serves the interests of Russian propaganda to play it \\nup as a major challenge, as something representing a major \\nfault line in our society, because it drives the message that \\nthe United States is in decline, the United States is in \\ncrisis, plays up to audiences at home in Russia and abroad that \\nthe United States is not the perfect society, something that \\nthey really like to emphasize.\\n    So that's an excellent example and I think it deserves the \\nattention, the spotlight that you cast on it. Mr. Watts \\nreferred to the minor protest outside our base in Incirlik in \\nTurkey. Well, there's another example, that there was a \\nprotest, but again it's blown out of all proportions.\\n    As you know, the best propaganda is that which has a grain \\nof truth to it and then gets played up and up and up.\\n    Senator Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Wyden.\\n    Senator Wyden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Let me say thank you to our witnesses. Gentlemen, here's \\nwhere we are now. The American people are worried about what's \\nahead with regard to Russia. The public now gets most of its \\ninformation from leaks, from daily press stories, and \\napparently inaccurate tweets from the President.\\n    This feeds distrust and causes Americans to question the \\nlegitimacy of our government. So I believe the committee needs \\nto lift the fog of secrecy about what really happened to our \\ndemocracy. That's why it's so important we have open hearings \\nwith the intelligence community, the FBI, Homeland Security, \\nand Treasury.\\n    I believe the key to a successful investigation is \\nfollowing the money. Yesterday I wrote a letter to the Chairman \\nand the Vice Chair urging the committee to look into any and \\nall financial relationships between Russia and Donald Trump and \\nhis associates.\\n    I'm also taking this issue on as the Ranking Member of the \\nFinance Committee, of which Senator Burr and Senator Warner are \\nalso members. I and other members of the Finance Committee have \\nalready urged that the committee exercise its authority to \\nobtain and review Donald Trump's tax returns. This review ought \\nto include the Trump Organization and its partnerships.\\n    Senate investigators should also look into any violations \\nof the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which ensures that \\ninvestors are not paying bribes overseas. The Treasury \\nDepartment is responsible for other programs and investigations \\nthat may uncover suspicious financial activities by Donald \\nTrump and his associates.\\n    It is already a matter of public record that entities \\nassociated with Donald Trump have been the subject of millions \\nof dollars of fines for willful, repeated, and longstanding \\nviolations of anti-money-laundering laws. Information about \\nDonald Trump's finances, his family, and his associates may \\nlead to Russia. We know that in 2008 the President's son said \\nthat ``Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section \\nof a lot of our assets.'' Since then, we've gotten mostly smoke \\nand mirrors.\\n    The committee needs to follow the money wherever it leads, \\nbecause if money-laundering, corruption of any kind, or fishy \\nreal estate deals point to the Russian oligarchs and criminal \\nelements, then the Russian government may only be a step or two \\naway from us.\\n    So now my question. There is an extraordinary history of \\nmoney-laundering in Russia. Billions of dollars from corruption \\nand other illegal activities have been moved out of the \\ncountry. What that means is that Russia's corruption problem \\nmay also be our corruption problem.\\n    So here's my question for the three of you as experts on \\nRussia. I'd like you three to tell us about corruption in \\nRussia so as to help us follow the money in our investigation.\\n    Here's my specific question. I'm going to start with you, \\nMr. Watts. How can the committee track this fuzzy line between \\nthe Russian oligarchs, Russian organized crime, and the Russian \\ngovernment?\\n    Mr. Watts. Thank you, Senator. I would first start off \\nwith, I'm not the foremost Russian expert. I came to this \\nthrough the Islamic State and ISIS. I'm really a \\ncounterterrorism person for the most part and came to active \\nmeasures mostly because active measures came after me.\\n    The second part that I would add to this discussion, \\nthough, is there is a money trail to be searched for and \\ndiscovered. We've focused very heavily on elites in our public \\ndiscussion, what are elite people doing. But this influence \\naction has both a virtual component and a physical component \\nthat's happened.\\n    I would say that what I can't see which I would want to \\nknow is: What is happening in Eastern Europe? There's a \\ndisproportionate number of fake news outlets, conspiratorial \\nwebsites, that are run from there, that are English-speaking \\neditors that are pro-Russian, trained in Russia sometimes. How \\nare they funded? That would be one component.\\n    My guess or my estimate, my hypothesis working in the \\nintelligence field, is that there is some sort of Russian intel \\nasset that is funding them in one way or another through some \\nsort of scheme.\\n    The other part that I think we should be looking at is \\nfollow the trail of dead Russians. There's been more dead \\nRussians in the past three months that are tied to this \\ninvestigation, who have assets in banks all over the world. \\nThey are dropping dead even in Western countries. We've seen \\narrests in I believe it's Spain and different computer security \\ncompanies that are based in Russia which provide services to \\nthe United States.\\n    These are all huge openings to understand how they are \\nfunded by the Russian government. I don't have the capability \\nto do that from where I sit, but I think that's a huge angle. \\nIf you can prove that part of it, I have to say on the \\ninfluence side of it we can see it.\\n    The one thing that's been misconstrued in the public \\ndiscussion about Russian influence is that it's covert. You can \\nhack stuff and be covert, but you can't influence and be \\ncovert. You have to ultimately show your hand. That's why we've \\nbeen able to discover it online.\\n    But the missing part is how did they conduct this \\ninfluence. There are newspapers, there are media outlets. The \\nBalkans are littered right now with these sorts of outlets. \\nThat's where I would start to dig in the financial space.\\n    Senator Wyden. I'm almost out of time. Dr. Rumer, same \\nthing. This fuzzy line is what I'm particularly interested in: \\norganized crime, oligarchs, and the government. I heard you \\ntalk about one person, you couldn't comment on him. But just \\ngive me your analysis about this fuzzy line, because I keep \\ncoming back to that.\\n    Dr. Rumer. It is definitely a fuzzy line, and I think those \\nrelationships are probably best discussed not in an open \\nsession, because----\\n    Senator Wyden. You're saying they ought to be discussed?\\n    Dr. Rumer. I believe they ought to be discussed.\\n    Senator Wyden. Good. Fair enough.\\n    Dr. Rumer. But I do believe that it is something for our \\nintelligence community to take up rather than for us to discuss \\nin open session.\\n    Senator Wyden. I probably ought to quit while I'm ahead----\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Blunt.\\n    Senator Wyden. Mr. Chairman, can Mr. Godson just finish \\nthat question?\\n    Chairman Burr. Dr. Godson, quickly.\\n    Dr. Godson. I'm very pleased----\\n    Chairman Burr. Turn your mike on.\\n    Dr. Godson. I'm very pleased that you're having this open \\nsession. I think it's very useful. But I do think that this is \\na sensitive subject and so that it will require skill and care \\non the part of our society so we don't overreact, which in our \\nhistory we sometimes have, to being surprised. So I do think \\nthere should be a time to discuss this.\\n    Senator Wyden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Blunt.\\n    Senator Blunt. Thank you, Chair.\\n    Dr. Godson, let's just start right there. Why do you think \\nwe--I've got about four questions, so they don't need to be \\nexhaustive, and I can follow up with more written questions \\nlater. And, Mr. Watts, I'm going to come to you next.\\n    Why do you think there was this element of surprise? I \\nmean, this is not new Russian activity in other places in the \\nworld. I think Mr. Watts said they had to start before 2016. \\nBut it does seem that the intel community, the U.S. Government, \\nthe media, is surprised that they have this level of \\ninvolvement. You just said we shouldn't have been surprised. \\nWhy do you think we were surprised?\\n    Dr. Godson. I do think it has something to do with our \\nculture, that we don't expect people to behave in this \\nparticular way. We've been surprised many times in our history, \\nso I don't think----\\n    Senator Blunt. We expect them to do it everywhere else, but \\nnot do it here?\\n    Dr. Godson. Well, we just are sort of surprised when \\nsomebody takes a concerted effort to be involved in our \\naffairs. We know that sometimes this happens abroad, but we \\ndon't really think this is a major tool or instrument that \\npeople use. So we found ourselves surprised in the 1940s and \\nthe 1970s and the 1980s and so on.\\n    So I'm not too surprised we are surprised.\\n    Senator Blunt. Mr. Watts, why do you think we seem to have \\nbeen so unready for this?\\n    Mr. Watts. One, our intelligence community has been \\noverfocused on terrorism and the Islamic State and there wasn't \\nmuch resources or bandwidth to focus on it. The second one is \\nour traditional methods for detecting and counter-intelligence, \\nthings like active measures, are based on HUMINTs. We run spies \\nversus counter-spies. Most of this influence came online. They \\nessentially duplicated the old active measures system without \\nsetting foot inside the United States.\\n    I think the third part of it is the intel community in the \\nUnited States is very biased against open source information. \\nThey've been surprised repeatedly: ISIS, the Arab Spring. You \\ncan go back over the past six to seven years. We worry a lot \\nabout security clearances and badges and who gets access to \\ndoors and does the break room have a shredder, but when it \\ncomes to the open source we miss what's right in front of our \\nnose.\\n    My two colleagues and I use three laptops and we do this at \\nour house. But for some reason the entire intel apparatus, with \\nbillions of dollars, will miss a tweet or a Facebook post \\nthat's right in front of them, but will be highly focused on \\nthe security system and these closed sources, which are super-\\nuseful. But we have not changed that orientation in our intel \\ncommunity.\\n    Senator Blunt. Mr. Rumer, in Europe do you think the \\ninterventions there were so obviously different that we \\nwouldn't have caught on? Or how do you see the difference in \\nwhat the Russians have done, particularly in the past 15 years, \\nin Europe and what they did here?\\n    Dr. Rumer. Well, there was an element of unpreparedness on \\nour part, I agree with my colleagues. I would say that--well, I \\ncan speak from personal experience and that is I just didn't \\nbelieve that any one intervention, any one agent, can swing our \\nelection across 50 states. I think--I thought nobody in their \\nright mind would try to take on the challenge of such expensive \\ncomplexity.\\n    But then when you think about it more carefully, as we have \\nnow with the benefit of hindsight, if you look at the election \\nof 2000, when the Florida vote was decided by a very small \\nnumber of votes, when we now know some of the votes were \\ndecided--some states were decided by a very small margin--you \\nrealize that a more sophisticated actor that has, as my \\ncolleagues have pointed out, years and decades of experience of \\nplaying in this field, can actually aspire to make a meaningful \\ndifference.\\n    Senator Blunt. Let me ask another question about that. I \\nknow the Vice Chairman mentioned hand-counting of ballots in \\nthe recent elections in one European country. You said that the \\nRussian intelligence services directly intervened. We don't \\nhave any reason to believe--any of you can answer this--that \\nthey intervened in any election counting system this time? I \\nthink we should be concerned that that never be allowed to \\nhappen and one of our goals here should be to be sure we're \\nprotecting that part of the process.\\n    But when you said directly intervened in the elections, no \\nindication, Mr. Rumer, of directly intervening anywhere in the \\ncounting of votes on election day?\\n    Dr. Rumer. Right. There are public statements from our \\nintelligence community and law enforcement and DHS that our \\ncounting systems have not been affected. I can only go on the \\nstrength of that and I fully believe that statement. But we \\ncertainly should be aware of that and concerned about it.\\n    Senator Blunt. Absolutely.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Heinrich.\\n    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Chairman.\\n    I want to start out by just thanking the Chairman and the \\nVice Chairman for their willingness to work so closely together \\non leading this investigation. I certainly think that today's \\nhearing is helpful in setting a baseline for the intentions and \\nthe techniques of Russia's active measures campaigns. But I \\nalso look forward to public hearings in which we can dig even \\ndeeper into the substance of what happened specifically in the \\n2016 election.\\n    Similarly, I believe it's critical that we dig into the \\nfinancial aspects involved and that we follow the money to \\ndetermine whether and how the Russians have used financial \\nleverage to achieve their strategic goals. I think we need to \\ndo everything possible to get to the truth. The American people \\ncertainly deserve no less, and I think if we do not take this \\nseriously it is not hyperbolic to say that our fundamental \\ndemocratic institutions are at risk.\\n    Dr. Godson said something in his statement for the record \\nabout the history of relying on agents of influence. In other \\nwords, recruiting and coopting sympathetic groups or \\nindividuals in the U.S. and in the West to advance the Russian \\nagenda. Do you all agree that financing is one of the methods \\noften used by Russia to recruit sympathetic agents?\\n    Dr. Godson. Yes.\\n    Dr. Rumer. Yes. There is publicly available evidence of a \\nMoscow-based bank financing one of the presidential candidates \\nin France.\\n    Senator Heinrich. When they use financial resources to \\nrecruit agents of influence, like the example you just made, is \\nit always a simple exchange of money for assistance or does \\nRussia sometimes attempt to buy influence more subtly, through \\naccess to lucrative business deals and contracts and those \\nkinds of arrangements?\\n    Dr. Godson. Yes, I think all of the above we can show \\nexamples of in the past.\\n    Dr. Rumer. Yes, they have used their considerable financial \\nbusiness leverage in Eastern Europe to cut favorable energy \\ndeals, to offer lucrative deals to local companies and \\ngovernments.\\n    Mr. Watts. I think the key point--and this is comparing it \\nto Soviet active measures today--is we didn't do business \\ntransactions with the Soviet Union. So they have so many more \\naccess points to compromise people financially or to influence \\nthem on the financial space that they couldn't have done during \\nthe Cold War.\\n    Senator Heinrich. This next question is for any of you. I'm \\ncurious if you see money in politics as an opening for Russia \\nto be able to potentially manipulate our elections, especially \\ngiven their expertise at moving financial resources through \\nnetworks and the change in our own environment, in which there \\nis now a lack of transparency in the current U.S. campaign \\nfinance environment, where oftentimes you have elections where \\na majority of the dollars spent are not even originating from \\nthe individual candidates themselves.\\n    Have any of you given that some thought?\\n    Mr. Watts. I think it's a little bit overstated, based on \\nthe public part of it. The Russians aren't stupid. They know \\nthat if they are ever caught directly putting money into what \\nlooks like a Manchurian candidate kind of scenario, this could \\nbe provocation for war or it could be sanctions. It could be a \\nhost of different things.\\n    At the same point, I would also offer you, from an \\nintelligence perspective, why not look at it as a way to \\ncompromise somebody? So if you have a candidate that's doing \\nwell and you have very open campaign finance, why not slip them \\nsome money where they don't know the original source of it, \\nsuch that if it's revealed later they are discredited?\\n    So it can go both ways. It's not just promotion. It can \\nalso be used as a tool and a weapon.\\n    Senator Heinrich. You, Mr. Watts, I think did a really good \\njob of laying out for us how these influence operations \\nactually have the impact of sort of organically changing the \\ntrends on media and end up being sort of a self-reinforcing \\nmechanism.\\n    Are there analytic or digital tools that can discount the \\nimpact of those bots and of that manufactured forcing mechanism \\nwithin the way that information travels on the web today and \\nimpacts the media?\\n    Mr. Watts. I think all the social media companies are \\nstarting to realize that their ad revenue mechanisms can be \\nmanipulated for this. There is more than just Russian fake news \\nout there. You've got profiteers, you've got political groups \\nthat do that, and you've got satire, which is thrown in the mix \\nof it.\\n    You're seeing the social media companies now try and \\nregulate this now or deem things as fake news, but that's going \\nto fail. Ultimately, any attempt to deem things as fake or not \\nfake is going to lead to freedom of speech violations, freedom \\nof the press violations, because how do you do that? How do you \\ndetermine who's being fair or not.\\n    I think a better way to do it and what we propose is to \\ncreate the version of Information Consumer Reports, which is an \\nindependent agency which is funded by the social media \\ncompanies, has no government involvement, no government \\nfunding, that provides a rating in terms of the news that shows \\nup on your feed, such that, much like nutrition labels on food, \\nyou know what you're consuming.\\n    Right now part of the reason this is so effective is a fake \\nnews outlet can pop up one day, pump out stories that are \\nsensational, and fall down the next. The consumer and American \\non their Facebook feed, which is curated to the things that \\nthey like to click on, and even in their Google searches, which \\nis curated to things other people like to click on like them, \\nend up clicking on these things because they're popular.\\n    If they had a score or a rating, some sort of symbol there, \\nthat said, you're more than welcome to click on this, but this \\nis the National Enquirer, you can evaluate how much of it is \\ntruth and how much is manipulated truth and how much is false--\\njust like we saw with Consumer Reports when I was growing up, \\nit had 15 variables, it's rated over time, and it becomes a \\ntrusted entity that you can go to.\\n    I think that's a better way to do it. We're not restricting \\nAmericans' freedom of speech and press, and at the same point \\nif they want to look at fake news they can look at it, but they \\nknow what they're getting into.\\n    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Lankford.\\n    Senator Lankford. It's hard to believe we're even having \\nthis hearing today discussing this topic, since Putin already \\ncleared this up earlier today. He came out with a public \\nstatement just hours ago saying: ``Watch my lips. No.'' and \\nthen followed up with: ``All these things are fictional, \\nillusory, provocations, lies, used for domestic American \\npolitical agendas. The anti-Russian card is played by different \\npolitical forces inside the United States to trade on and \\nconsolidate their positions inside.''\\n    Well, he's certainly consolidated us.\\n    It is painful to watch the Russian people trapped in a \\nregime that is doing this worldwide. They'd like to be able to \\nwatch the Olympics and know their athletes weren't doped ahead \\nof time. They would like to believe their own news when the \\nRussians proclaim, we're not in Ukraine and we're not in Syria, \\nand they are. And it would be nice if we could, as he said, \\n``Watch my lips'' and know that he's not trying to deceive our \\naudiences.\\n    My question is, first: Why did he think he could get away \\nwith it this time? This is not new for the Russians. They've \\ndone this for a long time across Europe. But he was much more \\nengaged this time in our election. Why now?\\n    Mr. Watts.\\n    Mr. Watts. I think this answer is very simple and is what \\nno one is really saying in this room, which is: Part of the \\nreason active measures have worked in this U.S. election is \\nbecause the Commander-in-Chief has used Russian active measures \\nat times against his opponents. On 14 August 2016, his campaign \\nchairman, after a debunked----\\n    Senator Lankford. When you say ``his,'' who's ``his''?\\n    Mr. Watts. Paul Manafort cited the fake Incirlik story as a \\nterrorist attack on CNN, and he used it as a talking point.\\n    On 11 October, President Trump stood on a stage and cited \\nwhat appears to be a fake news story from Sputnik News, that \\ndisappeared from the internet. He denies the intel from the \\nUnited States about Russia. He claimed that the election could \\nbe rigged. That was the number one theme pushed by RT, Sputnik \\nNews, white outlets all the way up until the election. He's \\nmade claims of voter fraud, that President Obama's not a \\ncitizen, that Congressman Cruz is not a citizen.\\n    So part of the reason active measures works and it does \\ntoday in terms of Trump Tower being wiretapped is because they \\nparrot the same lines. So Putin is correct, he can say that \\nhe's not influencing anything because he's just putting out his \\nstance. But until we get a firm basis on fact and fiction in \\nour own country, get some agreement about the facts, whether it \\nbe do I support the intelligence community or a story I read on \\nmy Twitter feed, we're going to have a big problem.\\n    I can tell you right now today, gray outlets that are \\nSoviet-pushing accounts, tweet at President Trump during high \\nvolumes when they know he's online and they push conspiracy \\ntheories. So if he is to click on one of those or cite one of \\nthose, it just proves Putin correct that, we can use this as a \\nlever against the Americans.\\n    Senator Lankford. So this started in 2008, 2009 time \\nperiod, as you've cited before with your previous timeline. \\nEven before this rose up, even when there were 16 Republican \\ncandidates on the stage, this was a long time coming and it \\nseemed to be very well organized this time.\\n    Part of my question is, I get that completely; why this \\ntime? They looked to be more prepared--probing, evaluating \\nstates, trying to get into voter records, trying to be more \\nactive in the process.\\n    Mr. Watts. They have plausible deniability. If you wanted \\nto run this during the Cold War, you would have had to put \\nagents inside the United States. They would have been stalked \\nby counter-intelligence professionals. They would have been run \\ndown. You couldn't have gained an audience on a communist \\nnewspaper, for example.\\n    Today you can create the content, gain the audience, build \\nthe bots, pick out the election and even the voters that are \\nvalued the most in swing states, and actually insert the right \\ncontent in a deliberate period. They pre-planned it. They were \\nbased a year and a half out. They're doing it today on the \\nEuropean elections.\\n    Here's the other thing that needs to come up. They try all \\nmessages. You know, we've been very focused on our presidential \\nelection. The Republicans tend to come up. But the Democrats, \\nthey were there, too. They were with Bernie Sanders supporters, \\ntrying to influence them in different directions.\\n    So they play all sides. Much like I learned in infantry \\nschool about how they use artillery, they fire artillery \\neverywhere and once they get a break in the wall that's where \\nthey swarm in and they focus. So they do that very well today.\\n    You'll see them in Europe supporting people on the left or \\nright, whichever will dismantle the democratic function that \\nthey're after. So I think the important point moving forward is \\nwe have to educate our public and even our institutions.\\n    And the mainstream media is right to be taking some on the \\nchin right now. They've fallen for a lot of these fake news \\nstories. They've amplified it and they've not gone back and \\ndone good fact-checking. The media needs to improve. Our U.S. \\nGovernment institutions need to improve, and we've got to help \\nAmericans understand what the facts are, because if we don't we \\nare lost. We will become two separate, maybe three, separate \\nworlds in the United States, just because of this little bitty \\npinprick that was put in by a foreign country.\\n    Senator Lankford. Which is their goal.\\n    On that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Manchin.\\n    Senator Manchin. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much.\\n    I want to thank Senator King for allowing me. I have \\nanother meeting I've got to attend. But I wanted to ask this \\nquestion.\\n    I've been around long enough to remember that my school \\ndesk at home protected me if I jumped underneath of it and held \\nmy head during a nuclear attack from Russia. I'm not sure that \\nmy United States Senate desk if I jump underneath of it and \\nhold my head will protect me this time, and that's putting it \\nmildly.\\n    With that being said, much has been written about the new \\nhybrid style of warfare practiced by the Russians recently in \\nGeorgia, Crimea, and Ukraine. To be brief, Russia believes the \\nlines between war and peace are blurred. Wars are no longer \\ndeclared and no longer fought in the traditional manner, and \\nthe power of non-military means to achieve objectives exceeds \\nthe power of weapons in effectiveness.\\n    Some label it the ``Gerasimov doctrine,'' which is a \\ncombination of political, military, economic, social, and media \\nmeans to achieve Russian strategic objectives. In the United \\nStates we would call this a whole-of-government approach.\\n    So my question would be to any of you, and I'll start with \\nyou, Mr. Watts, if possible: Is Russia's meddling in our 2016 \\nelection proof that the United States is dealing with a nation \\nthat is acting in its own warlike manner?\\n    Mr. Watts. Yes. Would you like me to comment on some of the \\nthings we can do?\\n    Senator Manchin. Please.\\n    Mr. Watts. There are seven or eight things we could do \\nimmediately that are not very complicated.\\n    Senator Manchin. My desk is not going to save me this time, \\nright?\\n    Mr. Watts. No. And I'll tell you right now, I'm going to \\nwalk out of here today, I'm going to be cyber-attacked, I'm \\ngoing to be discredited by trolls. My biggest fear isn't being \\non Putin's hit list or psychological warfare targeting. I've \\nbeen doing that for two years. My biggest concern right now is \\nI don't know what the American stance is on Russia and who's \\ngoing to take care of me.\\n    After years in the Army and the FBI, working in the intel \\ncommunities today, I'm going to walk out of here and ain't \\nnobody going to be covering my back. I'm going to be on my own. \\nSo that's very disconcerting. I think that speaks to what we \\nneed to do.\\n    One, in terms of falsehoods, we need to do two things. We \\nneed a State Department and a DHS website that immediately \\nrefutes when falsehoods are put out. These seem silly when they \\ncome out. Incirlik terrorist attack, for example. But the \\nquicker they're refuted, the faster they die on social media. \\nWe caught the Incirlik attack because it was refuted quickly. \\nWhen the Russians fake it, it gets exposed. If it goes on too \\nlong, it gets in the mainstream media and it runs out of \\ncontrol.\\n    The other part is the FBI. They're doing a great job in \\nterms of investigating hacking, but the hacking powers \\ninfluence. Whenever there's a hack we should immediately go in \\nand look at what was stolen and figure out what is the \\nanticipated smear campaign discrediting, how is this going to \\nbe weaponized in influence.\\n    The next one I think is super-important, which is educating \\nU.S. businesses. Treasury and Commerce right now need to be \\ndoing awareness campaigns. Their companies suffer smear \\ncampaigns from foreign countries right now which change their \\nstock prices. Their employees are in social media and are being \\npicked off through social engineering and hacked.\\n    The other part really is in the private sector and the \\npublic sector that we need to look at. Mainstream media \\ncompanies, we need to be working with them. What if they \\nboycotted WikiLeaks collectively? What if they all didn't race \\nto publish too quickly? If the damaging, stolen information \\nthat is misconstrued oftentimes, doesn't get into the \\nmainstream media, if all of them block it out, Russia's \\ninfluence dies on the vine.\\n    The last thing I think is the social media companies. \\nWhether we like it or not, social media has become the news \\nprovider for almost all Americans. Our preferences shape what \\nwe see and our friends share stuff with us and it reinforces \\nour views. So I think that for them, they're worried about \\nthese state-sponsored groups in their systems and how it's \\ngoing to erode their company.\\n    Senator Manchin. Dr. Godson, I'd like to ask you, if \\npossible, when the Iron Curtain fell and Russia fell out of the \\nworld power status, superpower status I might say, how long was \\nthat hiatus? And when it came back, did it come back with a \\nvengeance because of Putin's leadership and determination not \\nto be shelved?\\n    Dr. Godson. I wish we had more information about this. Some \\nareas we know a lot and in some areas----\\n    Senator Manchin. Well, did you see basically a drop-off \\nduring the 1990s?\\n    Dr. Godson. We do see a bit of a drop-off, yes. However, \\nthe training, the development of cadre, continues. The \\nhierarchy wasn't well established in terms of controlling all \\nthe various----\\n    Senator Manchin. Was it under Putin basically all this came \\nback? Can anybody say that?\\n    Dr. Rumer.\\n    Dr. Rumer. Yes, sir. In the 1990s Russia was flat on its \\nback. It just didn't have the resources and a lot of the \\ncapital in this area that it had accumulated basically fell \\napart. I think they were very, very frustrated during the \\nBalkan wars when they really couldn't counter what they saw as \\nour information domination of the airwaves. So in the early \\n2000s when their economy came back, the apparatus came back \\nwith it, too.\\n    Could I just add one----\\n    Senator Manchin. Could I just ask one thing, because my \\ntime is running down here? Under Putin do you believe it's \\nimpossible to build a relationship to basically bring this back \\ninto some type of civility or order? Or is he just absolutely \\ntotally committed in the direction he's been going and will \\ncontinue to go no matter what?\\n    Dr. Godson. Can I just add in answer to that?\\n    Senator Manchin. Quickly.\\n    Dr. Godson. It depends on what the costs are. In other \\nwords, what are we going to do in response?\\n    Senator Manchin. He only reacts to power out of power.\\n    Dr. Godson. Beg your pardon?\\n    Senator Manchin. He only reacts back out of strength, if we \\nhave strength.\\n    Dr. Godson. Most of us react to power and strength, too. \\nBut in this case we don't yet have enough information. The \\ncommittee and the study that you're doing is very important for \\nus, not just scholars studying this subject. It's very \\nimportant because we can't really answer the question about why \\nthis time and why it's successful. We're not even sure what \\nhappened here. We have the ICA statement of January.\\n    But I just sort of want to put in a note of caution here. \\nWe sometimes in the United States think we know things and we \\nhave our sort of group-think and we all express certain views. \\nAnd then we find out that later on maybe the sources of our \\nevidence, the way we put the evidence together, didn't really \\nmake as much sense as we thought it did at the time.\\n    Now, we've had that in our recent experience in the 1990s \\nand 2002 and 2003, and so on. I would just say we need a little \\nbit of caution here to be able to know exactly what happened. \\nThere's so much information out, real and false and a mixture.\\n    Senator Manchin. I want to thank you so much. I'm really \\nexceeding my time. They've been so kind to me. But thank you.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Cotton.\\n    Senator Cotton. Thank you, gentlemen, for your appearance \\nthis morning.\\n    I want to return to the topic Senator Lankford broached, \\nwhich is why Vladimir Putin and Russia's leaders thought they \\ncould get away with such a brazen set of actions last year, and \\ndoing so in a, quote, ``noisy'' fashion, as Director Comey \\ntestified last week. Dr. Godson, I'd like to hear your point of \\nview on this.\\n    Specifically, I'd like to hear your thoughts about the \\ncontext in which Vladimir Putin did this in 2015 and 2016. In \\nthe previous eight years, Russia had invaded Georgia, it had \\ninvaded and seized Crimea, its rebels had been supported in \\nEastern Ukraine to occupy the Donbas, they'd been provided \\nmissiles and shot a civilian aircraft out of the sky. Russia \\nhad repeatedly violated the INF Treaty.\\n    The Obama Administration had come into office proclaiming a \\nreset and in 2012 Barack Obama mocked his opponent for claiming \\nthat Russia was our number one foe and promised Dmitry Medvedev \\nthat more could be done after the election when he had more \\nflexibility.\\n    Would that series of events have emboldened Vladimir Putin \\nto think he might be able to get away with such a noisy \\nintrusion into our political system?\\n    Dr. Godson. I would suggest that you're right. I think that \\nthis does not help in restraining Russian interest in expanding \\nin the near abroad and as far abroad as they can. So that the \\ntrain of actions you described there didn't exactly persuade \\nhim that we would take his intervening in other matters, such \\nas elections, seriously.\\n    So it's going to take, I think, some time and some activity \\nby the United States, some important activity, to be able to \\nestablish our reputation in this arena. I know it's beyond the \\ngist of the arena for the Intelligence Committee, but \\nintelligence can play a major role in this. But I think that \\nthis is a whole-of-government, this is a policy issue, and it's \\nmore than intelligence.\\n    But I would hope, though, that we are in fact gaining the \\nkinds of information we need to have an informed judgment about \\nwhat you are asking about, in other words was he tempted by our \\nlack of action? I hope, I presume, that the intelligence \\ncommunity has a tasking that identifies the Soviet responses \\nand their perceptions and that if we don't have such a tasking \\non this subject then we won't be in a very good position to \\nact.\\n    But I think in general, yes, I agree with the point you're \\nmaking. I think the evidence is strong, but we need stronger \\ninformation, too, to give us better judgment on this kind of \\nissue.\\n    Senator Cotton. Dr. Rumer, I don't think you've had a \\nchance to opine on this question yet.\\n    Dr. Rumer. Thank you, sir. I believe that the biggest \\nfactor in Putin's decision to pursue this aggressive line of \\nintervention in our domestic politics has been the realization \\non their part, as Mr. Watts suggested, that this is a very \\nlucrative environment in which they can achieve a lot with even \\na remotely plausible claim of deniability. So I think they just \\ntook advantage of the environment here.\\n    Senator Cotton. Mr. Watts.\\n    Mr. Watts. Yes, I'd like to add to what I said before. One, \\nI don't think they thought their hand was going to be exposed \\nas much as it is today. I think they thought they could do it \\nin a more subtle fashion. So my belief is right now in Russia \\nthey're probably trying to figure out, how do I manage this \\nsituation now where I have extended myself?\\n    But the overriding issue with why Russia did this to the \\nUnited States and does it now to Europe is we are weak. We do \\nnot respond. We have no organized response as a country or even \\na policy toward Russia right now. So I think until we set the \\nboundaries about how we are going to either push forward with \\nthem, they're going to move as far as they can push. And then \\nwhen we set our policy positions, which we don't have right \\nnow, they'll move in kind based on whatever that is.\\n    Senator Cotton. I have one final question about active \\nmeasures. Dr. Godson, you talked in your testimony or in your \\nopening statement about some of the history of Russian active \\nmeasures. It's been going on for a long time. Bob Gates, former \\nDirector of the CIA and Secretary of Defense, wrote in his \\nfirst memoir, ``From the Shadows,'' about Russia's campaign \\nagainst the NATO deployment of intermediate-range nuclear \\nforces in Europe in 1983, quote:\\n    ``During the period, the Soviets mounted a massive covert \\naction operation aimed at thwarting INF deployments by NATO. We \\nat the CIA devoted tremendous resources and effort at the time \\nto uncovering this Soviet covert campaign.'' End quote.\\n    The United States is currently undergoing a long-delayed, \\ndeeply needed nuclear modernization campaign, upgrading our \\nbombers, our dual-capable aircraft, our ground-based missiles, \\nour long-range standoff cruise missile, and our submarine \\ncapability as well.\\n    Do you believe there is any chance that Russia is not \\ncurrently engaged in an active measures campaign to try to \\nthwart that modernization effort in the United States?\\n    Dr. Godson. No, I think you're right. I think you're right. \\nI do believe almost certainly that they are. If not already \\nengaged in it, they will be.\\n    Senator Cotton. Because that is simply what Russia does.\\n    Dr. Godson. That is simply what this particular leadership, \\nsuccessors to the previous generation, yes, I believe, do. I \\ndon't think it's inevitable Russians will do this, but I think \\nthese fellows will do it.\\n    Senator Cotton. I apologize, gentlemen. My time has \\nexpired.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator King.\\n    Senator King. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\n    Just to sort of sum up what I've heard this morning: Number \\none, it appears that we're engaged in a new form of aggression, \\nif not war, that the Soviet Union and now Russia has been \\nutilizing for many years, but is now taking it to a much higher \\nlevel. It strikes me that Vladimir Putin is playing a weak hand \\nvery well.\\n    A couple of questions, very, very short. I would say that \\nwhat we've seen and what you've told us this morning is that \\nwhat we saw in the 2016 election is absolutely consistent with \\nprior Russian practice and current Russian practice in other \\nparts of Europe and the world. Is that correct, Mr. Watts?\\n    Mr. Watts. Yes, it's still going on today.\\n    Senator King. Secondly, is it your opinion that this is \\ngoing to continue? In other words, 2016 is not a one-off?\\n    Mr. Watts. No. I mean, they're going to continue until \\nsomething meets their challenge, and right now there's nothing \\nmeeting their challenge. Any European effort I've seen is very \\nsmall in comparison.\\n    Senator King. Mr. Rumer, would you say that, Dr. Rumer, \\nthat Putin is a Democrat, a Republican, or an opportunist?\\n    Dr. Rumer. I think he's an opportunist. And even if we \\ncounter this or when we counter his efforts, he will continue \\nanyway. It's going to be a dynamic, not a sort of static \\nsituation where we deploy countermeasures and it stops. He will \\nkeep going on it.\\n    Senator King. I think it's very important, though, that we \\nrealize that he is neither a Democrat nor a Republican, because \\nit means that everybody on this dais and everybody in political \\nlife in America regardless of their party is at risk. In 2016 \\nit happened to tilt because of his interest toward the \\npolitical candidate of the Republican Party. But it could very \\nwell be the opposite in 2020 or 2022.\\n    Mr. Watts, you're nodding, but we can't record that.\\n    Mr. Watts. Yes, they will shift to whichever one supports \\nor is most amenable to their foreign policy position or who \\nthey think is weak for manipulation. They will go with \\nwhichever one it is.\\n    Senator King. And one thing that was mentioned today \\nsomewhat briefly, but it came up in some of the questions, is \\nnot only did they hack the Democratic National Committee and \\nmisinformation and disinformation and all of that, but they \\nalso pushed and probed into our State election systems in a \\nnumber of states. Apparently the information that we have thus \\nfar is it didn't work. But they tried.\\n    Mr. Watts, would you agree that they weren't trying for \\nfun? This wasn't entertainment; they were looking for a place \\nto make changes in election results?\\n    Mr. Watts. What no one's talking about is the information \\nnukes that Russia sits on right now because they hacked 3,000 \\nto 4,000 people. I think this afternoon you're going to hear on \\nthe cyber more technical side, this hacking was pervasive. \\nWe've focused on the DNC. I've been targeted. Some other people \\nhave been targeted that I know.\\n    They have our information, so any time anyone rises up that \\nthey choose against, whether it's Republican or a Democrat, \\nCongress or Executive Branch or a State official, they've got \\nthe ability to do the same thing they just did over the past \\nyear.\\n    Senator King. I want to touch on that in a minute, but I do \\nwant--do you believe that they will try again to compromise \\nState-level election voting machines, registration rolls?\\n    Mr. Watts. They could.\\n    Senator King. They tried this time.\\n    Mr. Watts. I don't think it's about breaking into the \\nelection machines. The goal is to create the perception that \\nthe vote may not be authentic. So that's why it's smart to \\ntarget voter rolls, because just the act of hitting a voter \\nroll doesn't change the vote, but then you can run an influence \\nstory that says there's voter fraud in the United States, that \\nthe election is rigged, that the count wasn't accurate, and you \\ncan gain traction with it. It's a pinprick perception that \\nthey're trying to create.\\n    Senator King. You have mentioned several times, and I think \\nthe Russian term is, ``kompromat.'' I think it's interesting \\nthat they have a Russian term which is compromising \\ninformation. This is active in the sense that not only can they \\ntake things off your computer, they can put things on your \\ncomputer that will compromise you. I think that should send a \\nshudder through all Americans, that this isn't only taking--you \\ncan be very careful in your emails, but something can show up \\non your computer that's fake and you could be in a lot of \\ntrouble.\\n    This is one of their techniques, is it not?\\n    Mr. Watts. Yes. Americans should look to Europe, where this \\nhas happened quite a bit more frequently.\\n    Senator King. Finally, we talked a bit about--you talked a \\nbit about defenses. I think this is something that our \\ncommittee in its report is going to have to look at. Cyber \\nstrategy is one. We have no cyber strategy in this country. \\nThere's no knowledge around the world of how we will react to a \\ncyber attack, and I think that's part of what we have to do.\\n    Digital literacy, and that is people understanding the \\nlimitations of what they have on the internet. My wife has a \\nsign in our kitchen that says ``The problem with quotes on the \\ninternet is you can't determine whether they're authentic. \\nAbraham Lincoln.'' We have to educate our people that they \\ncan't believe everything that they read on the internet, and \\npart of that is I think your very creative suggestion of a kind \\nof Snopes, expanded Snopes, to check the validity, so people at \\nleast know, okay, there's some likelihood that that is untrue. \\nAnd finally, public awareness, which is what this hearing is \\nall about.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.\\n    Chairman Burr. Thank you, Senator King.\\n    Senator Cornyn.\\n    Senator Cornyn. Mr. Chairman, let me start by complimenting \\nyou and the Vice Chairman again for your leadership. This is \\nreally important. I saw Senator Lankford and Senator----\\n    Chairman Burr. King.\\n    Senator Cornyn [continuing]. King, thank you--I had a \\nblank--on TV this morning talking about why this was so \\nimportant to our country and why it's so important we have a \\nbipartisan investigation and follow the facts wherever they may \\nlead.\\n    Mr. Watts, let me follow up on some of what Senator King \\nwas alluding to. I remember, of course, it wasn't that long ago \\nwhere the Office of Personnel Management was hacked and 21 \\nmillion records, personnel records, were stolen of U.S. \\nGovernment workers. Of that, about 5 million plus fingerprints \\nincluded.\\n    I'm also remembering that a few years ago there was a \\nstory--I think it was in 2016--a story about the tactics that \\nPutin uses to discredit political opponents in Russia and \\nelsewhere. The New York Times story I pulled up said: ``Foes of \\nRussia say child pornography is planted to ruin them.'' The \\nsort of tactics that are being used both domestically and \\ninternationally against foes of the Putin administration, the \\nsort of hacks, the cyber attacks and the access to personnel \\nrecords, the computers of all of us--all of these render us \\nsusceptible to this sort of influence campaigns, correct?\\n    Mr. Watts. Yes. Americans need to understand that anything \\nthey do on the computer can be public at some point.\\n    Senator Cornyn. And just because it appears on the computer \\ndoesn't necessarily mean it's true?\\n    Mr. Watts. Correct. Fact and fiction have been wildly \\nblurred over the past few years.\\n    Senator Cornyn. Regarding the last election and Putin's \\nactive measures effort, is it reasonable to conclude that any \\nefforts made to weaken the candidacy of Hillary Clinton by \\ndoing damage to her reputation, credibility, and political \\nstanding would have been a desirable outcome for Russia even if \\nshe were elected President?\\n    Mr. Watts. Yes. The goal was either to get your candidate \\nelected that you approve of or to just totally discredit and \\nundermine the mandate of whoever does win should it be your \\nopponent.\\n    Senator Cornyn. Mr. Rumer.\\n    Dr. Rumer. Yes, sir, I agree.\\n    Senator Cornyn. So do we have any reason to believe that \\nPutin knew more than the pundits and pollsters did here in \\nAmerica about the outcome of the election before it occurred?\\n    Mr. Watts. No.\\n    Senator Cornyn. The electoral result is what I'm referring \\nto. I didn't think so.\\n    Dr. Godson, you mentioned earlier, and I believe several of \\nyou alluded to this--about a strategic approach to \\ncountermeasures. Would you briefly describe what some of those \\nmight be? And I would like to have a more extended conversation \\nat some point about what each of you would recommend for the \\nUnited States Government to do to engage in a strategic \\napproach of countermeasures to this sort of campaign.\\n    Dr. Godson.\\n    Dr. Godson. Well, we have had a historical precedent for \\ndeveloping that strategic approach. This is actually what \\nhappened in the Reagan years, that we decided that there was a \\nmajor active measures offensive, much higher than people had \\nexpected, and we had to respond. So there were a couple of \\nthings that were done then which seemed to be quite effective \\nand I would recommend we take those things that worked and put \\nthem into our strategic approach.\\n    Senator Cornyn. Could you give us a few examples?\\n    Dr. Godson. Yes. One is what we're sort of starting to do \\nnow and what you're starting to do, is educating the American \\nand other populations about the threat of active measures and \\nthe price one can pay for successful active measures, so that \\nwhen they know and hear about it they're not taken by it, it \\ndoesn't influence them. One is education.\\n    A second capability that we would need would be ways of \\nreducing the effectiveness of the active measures: warning, \\nanticipating, education, and then what can be done to reduce \\nthe effectiveness of the active measures? One of the things \\nthat worked in the past was exposing the perpetrators of the \\nactive measures, preferably in real time, but anyway exposure.\\n    Senator Cornyn. As Mr. Watts pointed out, the advent of \\nsocial media and the use of social media to move fake stories \\naround the internet and to get mainstream media to pay \\nattention to them, and without authenticating the source of the \\ninformation, then repeating it, successfully amplifying that \\nmessage, strikes me as a huge challenge.\\n    All of us have run for elections and had to deal with the \\nchanges in the way we communicate with each other. It is a huge \\nchallenge. I don't know how we get to the bottom of this and \\nfind some site, some trusted site, government or otherwise, \\nthat says this is the truth, this is not the truth, don't \\nbelieve what you're being told.\\n    Dr. Godson. Senator, we did have some good experience with \\nit. We didn't have the machines. They didn't have those \\ncapabilities, the mechanical capabilities. But we still were \\nable to discredit a lot of their active measures and the \\napparatus, and so it was effective for a while.\\n    The third part of this, though, really the hard part, is \\nwhat kind of whole-of-government responses are we going to \\ndevelop to actually deal with the problem? We sort of have to \\ncome to grips with this. As I said, this may not be the only \\ncommittee that has to deal with this. But we have to say, what \\nare we willing to tolerate? Are there any red lines for us, \\nthat if they go over this line then there will be these kinds \\nof responses?\\n    We developed this kind of deterrence policy. We have rules \\nof the road in deterrence so both sides don't get too close to \\neach other on the nuclear weapons issues. But we're going to \\nhave to start to figure out what it is we're going to do and \\nwhat we're going to accept and what we're going to tolerate and \\nwhat kinds of responses we're going to have, not just once in a \\nwhile, but consistently in this arena. I thank you for the \\nquestion.\\n    Senator Cornyn. Thank you.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Burr. Senator Harris.\\n    Senator Harris. Thank you, and I want to thank the Chairman \\nand Vice Chairman for this open hearing. As this committee \\nconducts its investigation into Russia's interference with our \\n2016 United States election, the American people need to fully \\nunderstand the threat that we face and what we must do to \\nprotect ourselves in the future.\\n    Let's all be clear about what happened. We know, as has \\nalready been determined by the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, a \\nforeign country, Russia, attacked the heart of our democracy, \\nan American election for the President of the United States. \\nAnd they can and will do so again if we do not act urgently.\\n    We must get to the bottom of this. We must be thorough. We \\nmust proceed with urgency. And we must be transparent. That is \\nvital to protect the public's trust in us and it's what the \\nAmerican people deserve. I know we can do so while protecting \\nclassified sources and material items that must remain \\nclassified in order to protect our national security, the \\nsources of our intelligence, and the sensitive methods by which \\nwe collect it.\\n    This hearing is a first step to understand Russia's \\ninterference, but it cannot end here. We must build on today's \\nhearing with future open hearings as much as possible. I \\nstrongly believe an informed public is one of our best weapons \\nagainst future attacks.\\n    That being said, I have a question for all of you, and I'll \\nstart with Mr. Watts. Earlier this week, former Vice President \\nCheney said Russia's interference in our election should be \\nconsidered an act of war. Assuming this was an act of war, \\nRussia is investing in cyber weapons and cyber soldiers, which \\nwe call trolls, while we continue to invest in conventional \\nweapons. As we invest in fighter jets and aircraft carriers, \\nRussia is investing in state-run media from which it can push \\nout fake news.\\n    As we consider investing more than $600 billion in our \\ndefense budget, Russia has approximately one-tenth of that \\namount in their budget and is developing its cyber warfare \\ncapabilities. I strongly believe cyber may be the new frontier \\nof war.\\n    So my question to you is: Was this an act of war and are we \\nprepared for this new form of warfare? And equally important, \\ngiven the everyday challenges of Americans in their everyday \\nlives, why should they be concerned about this?\\n    Mr. Watts. On the first part, an act of war, on the scale \\nof warfare, it's not kinetic, but it's definitely part of the \\nCold War system that we knew 20, 30 years ago. Americans should \\nbe concerned because right now a foreign country, whether they \\nrealize it or not, is pitting them against their neighbor, \\nother political parties, ramping up divisions based on things \\nthat aren't true.\\n    They're trying to break down the trust they have in you as \\na Senator, the Congress, the legislature, the court system. \\nThey're trying to break down all faith in those institutions. \\nAnd if they can do that, if Americans don't believe that their \\nvote counts, they're not going to show up to participate in \\ndemocracy. If they don't believe that what they're doing is \\npart of a government system that actually represents them, \\nthey're not going to go to jury duty. If they don't believe in \\nthose institutions, everything breaks down, and when that \\nbreakdown occurs we are focusing internally and Russia is \\nfocused externally, achieving their goals.\\n    In terms of investments, part of the reason we don't invest \\nwell in cyber and we don't invest in information is because \\nwe're not buying big pieces of equipment. If you can't buy a \\nbig piece of equipment, then it's really hard to invest your \\ndollars. We need to invest in people. The reason Russians win \\nin cyber and information space is they have great propagandists \\nand they have the best hackers that are out there, that they \\ncan either enlist because they're criminals and sort of bring \\nthem under the umbrella or train themselves.\\n    We, on the other hand, worry a lot about who we're going to \\nbring into the cyber field because they might have smoked weed \\none day or they can't pass the security clearance or they \\ndidn't get a score on their ASVAB, but there's millions, I mean \\nmillions, of talented Americans out there that can support \\nthese roles inside our government. We need to invest in humans \\nmoving forward in this space.\\n    It's hard to get Americans to understand that or even the \\nDepartment of Defense, because you're talking about cyber and \\ncomputers and so you think of tech. But the truth is that tech \\nonly works if you've got the smartest brains behind it. We do, \\nbut we don't put them against our fight.\\n    Senator Harris. Thank you.\\n    Dr. Rumer.\\n    Dr. Rumer. I think we should be careful using terms such as \\n``an act of war.'' It's definitely the continuation of warfare \\nby other means, but when you declare something to be an act of \\nwar it calls for certain responses that we may not be ready to \\ntake on.\\n    I do agree with Mr. Watts on the need to be much more \\ncreative, much more resourceful, in the way we approach the \\nquestion of, quote, ``cyber warfare.'' I again would caution \\nthat the Russians have a very different standard here in using \\ntheir offensive tools than we use in using our cyber tools with \\na great deal of responsibility, and I think we should be very \\ncareful not to cross certain lines.\\n    We should, however, be using the tools that are available \\nto us and platforms that are available to us just from a \\nsomewhat different domain. I think that our own spokesmen, our \\nown information projected and delivered from our platforms, \\nshould be the gold standard of accuracy and objectivity. So \\nfrom that standpoint, let me just say that we're not using, for \\nexample, the platform of the State Department effectively. The \\npractice of not sustaining our regular briefings for the media \\nfor the world is something that only hurts our interests.\\n    Senator Harris. Thank you.\\n    Dr. Godson. I agree with my colleagues, so I won't repeat \\nthe same conclusions they reached. I would, though, like to \\nintroduce the idea that cyber is now important. Cyber wasn't \\nconsidered so important 20 years ago, now considered important. \\nBut there are other technologies coming on board now. Some are \\nvisible to us. Some, they're not very salient; they haven't \\nrisen above the horizon.\\n    There are a whole number of technologies that are not \\ninternet-dependent. As we look at active measures now and into \\nthe future, I would think that would be on the agenda. I'll \\ngive you just one example--virtual reality. Anybody who can set \\nup the reality is going to have a very decided advantage in \\npolitics and other areas.\\n    So as we are looking at cyber--and you are going to have \\nthis hearing and other studies on this--I would say just that \\nwe should be broadening the concept of technologies that are \\ngoing to be available, coming online, and it would be extremely \\nunlikely that the Russians would ignore those technologies. So \\nmaybe that would be something to add to the already busy agenda \\nthat you have.\\n    Thank you.\\n    Senator Harris. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Burr. Thank you, Senator.\\n    Thank you to all of our witnesses. All the questions have \\nbeen asked except for mine. So let me, if I could, spend just a \\ncouple of minutes. I agree with you, Dr. Godson, the ability to \\nimpersonate online is the next phase that we will go through. I \\nthink it's safe to say we don't have our best and brightest yet \\nfocused on that. We're still trying to triage what happened to \\nus versus to be creative and look forward and say what could \\nhappen.\\n    Mr. Watts, I heard you talk about intent and specifically \\nthe intent of the Russians and their effectiveness and how pre-\\nplanning played a large part of the 2016 effort. Here's my \\ndisconnect, is that when you--at least on the surface, as we've \\ngotten into the investigation, as you look at the emails that \\nwere captured either out of the DNC or out of the Podesta \\naccount that were then the source of Russia's effort through \\nWikiLeaks to publicly lay this out, that seemed to be an \\naverage, ordinary Russian fishing expedition, that we captured \\nmaybe 3,000 efforts at the same period in time.\\n    So are you suggesting that they had an effort to mess with \\nthe elections and just happened to be lucky enough to stumble \\nacross a volume of emails?\\n    Mr. Watts. They go widespread. Whatever the best nuggets \\nthat come out of that is what they run with. They hit a gold \\nmine and they were able to successfully find the ammunition \\nthey wanted. What you see in other cases is they do compromise \\nother accounts--I'm not going to talk about them; I don't want \\nto amplify them--but they're less successful. You know, we'll \\nhear a dump and you'll be like, oh, this isn't really anything \\nother than what I expected a politician to say.\\n    So they hit a whale whenever they went fishing. But I would \\nalso say that somewhere in their cache right now there is \\ntremendous amounts of information laying around they can \\nweaponize against other Americans.\\n    Chairman Burr. We would agree with you on that.\\n    Very quickly, as you sort of summarized how fake news and \\nhow coordinated social media efforts push stories to the top \\nten and they get picked up automatically, what is the takeaway \\nfor U.S. media outlets from what you just said?\\n    Mr. Watts. They have to improve their editorial processes \\nand they also have to take a step back from the ``I gotta get \\nit out first'' competitive environment. Part of the reason this \\nRussian system works is every outlet races to get the story out \\nfirst. When they do that, they put themselves at risk to fall \\nfor these sorts of schemes. Until they improve that or until \\nthey collectively, we have some sort of standard that either \\nthe public or the media holds itself to, we're going to keep \\nseeing them fall for these campaigns, whether it's Russia, by \\nthe way, or others. You're going to see many other nations take \\nthis on now that the playbook's been thrown out there.\\n    Chairman Burr. Dr. Rumer, would you like to take the \\nopportunity to address in greater detail what the Russians are \\ndoing in the French and German elections?\\n    Dr. Rumer. Well, sir, there's a wide effort in the German \\nelection to build up the far-right party, Alternative for \\nGermany, AfG, to use them as sort of a credible challenger to \\nChancellor Angela Merkel. There are countless stories that are \\nbeing spread through fake news sites and media about the \\nfailures of Chancellor Merkel. They, as others have pointed \\nout, have exploited the story about the girl that was not \\nraped, but to again discredit her in the eyes of the general \\npublic so as to point out her failure to protect Germany \\nagainst the flood of refugees. That's one of their major policy \\ninitiatives that she took when the Syria crisis broke out.\\n    In the French election, we just saw something that really \\nwas staggering and that is President Putin hosted in the \\nKremlin the leading far-right candidate and, almost with a \\nsmirk, said that: ``We don't interfere in French elections, but \\nwe have the right to engage any candidate in the public domain \\nin that contest.''\\n    Also, Russian disinformation sources have spread malicious \\nstories about one of the leading candidates, Emmanuel Macron, \\nabout his personal life.\\n    Chairman Burr. For the first time, we're really beginning \\nto see an effort to build up and to absolutely destroy the \\ncharacter of others, having a double impact potentially on the \\noutcome of the election?\\n    Dr. Rumer. Yes, sir.\\n    Chairman Burr. Dr. Godson, just quickly, how did we respond \\ndifferently when we overcame these active measures by Russians \\npre-1980? And is there a lesson for us to learn from that in \\nour actions now?\\n    Dr. Godson. I think there are a number of lessons, but one \\nwas this exposure business, that we learned how to put out \\ninformation to the public domain that not only was relevant for \\nAmericans, but for foreigners. And we briefed that and we \\ndeveloped teams that could go out and talk about these things \\nand so neutralize a lot.\\n    That was one of the methods that we could replicate. A \\nsecond was support to elements abroad who are trying to \\nmaintain the democratic process. We developed some capabilities \\nto do that. We still have some. One of the outstanding examples \\nis the National Endowment for Democracy--bipartisan, able to do \\nquite a lot, but it also limited in various ways. So one could \\nlook back to see how we were able to do this in different ways \\nabroad that had an effect in the past. It's not that expensive \\nfinancially and those methods are available.\\n    Chairman Burr. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Watts, just very briefly, has anybody taken you up on \\nyour list of recommendations?\\n    Mr. Watts. No.\\n    Chairman Burr. That did not go unnoticed by the committee. \\nI want you to know that. Nor did the comment that there was \\nagreement on at the table, that America's response to date has \\nbeen woefully short of what it should be; if anything, it \\nshould be interpreted, and probably was interpreted, by the \\nRussians that they can double down and in fact do it unscathed.\\n    So Mr. Watts, we heard you when you said fact and fiction \\nhad become wildly blurred. Let me just assure you that this \\ncommittee's mission every day is to do the oversight on the \\nintelligence community, 17 agencies, that assures the American \\npeople we do everything within the letter of the law. We first \\nassure that to 85 other members of the Senate. So when it came \\ntime for a look inside what Russia active measures did and what \\nour response was and how our intelligence community came to the \\nassessments that they did, this fell right in our wheelhouse.\\n    This is what our professional staff does on a daily basis. \\nThis is a little more granular than what we do. It will take \\nsome time and it means triaging a tremendous amount of \\ndocuments.\\n    But I also heard from all three of you that if there was \\never a time to get it right, it's now. We have methodically \\nbuilt a process that builds a foundation of fact, to build an \\ninvestigation on that foundation that can hopefully come to a \\nbipartisan finding where the conclusions are matched with the \\nfacts that we find.\\n    In some cases, as all three of you know, that might be \\nintelligence product that can't be made public. But in every \\nplace that we can, I have pledged to the Vice Chairman and he \\nhas pledged to his members and I have pledged to mine, where we \\ncan make it public so that the American people understand it \\nand feel that this has been credible and thorough and that the \\nconclusions are valid, we're going to try to do that.\\n    But I also believe that the American people expect us to \\nprotect sources and methods. They expect us to work with the \\nintelligence community in a way that strengthens what they do \\nand how they do it, not by sharing that with everybody, but by \\ncertifying that they're doing it within the letter of the law \\nto keep America safe.\\n    I look at this investigation as one extension of that and \\nit's to once again certify to the American people what we've \\ndone has been thorough, to hopefully provide some actionable \\nconclusions for this Administration, and to look back on the \\nwork that we do and believe that in 2018 and 2020 we're going \\nto be less concerned with Russia's involvement in our elections \\nand that the United States of America should, like we do on \\nterrorism, work with any country in the world that might be the \\ntarget of an aggressor like Vladimir Putin.\\n    So I'm grateful to you for what you've contributed to our \\ninvestigation.\\n    This hearing is now adjourned.\\n    [Whereupon, at 12:31 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]\\n  \\n\\n                                  [all]\\n\\n\""
